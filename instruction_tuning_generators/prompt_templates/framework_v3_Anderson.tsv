Step explanation: Initial, general, global, intuitive, evaluative response. Utterance example: Wow! That’s bright! Makes me think of the Big Apple. Questioning example: How does this work of art make you feel? Feedback example: Let’s avoid the words “good” and “bad” in expressing since normative judgments are premature at this point.	Step explanation: Obvious thematic, formal, and technical. Description tells us what an object is and what it is for. Begin with obvious features, such as representational and illusional qualities. Utterance example: This is a picture of birds and fish metamorphosing into each other. Questioning example: And the orange thing is the cloud.What’s going on? Feedback example: Let’s begin with general statements of obvious thematic content and then work to the specifics of detail and form.	Step explanation: Look for formal relationships between forms and images. Differences such as changes in rhythm or one thing’s being bigger, darker, brighter than another are particularly significant clues for meaning. Focus on principles of design: unity, variety, focus, rhythm and so on. Questioning example: What strikes you as formally significant in the work? Feedback example: Art works are all of a piece. There are no parts in an artwork that do not count, all forms and relationships have expressive significance. So let’s attempt to impart meaning to these forms in the same holistic spirit in which they were constructed.	Step explanation: Intended impact of the forms, colors, theme, and their relationships. Characterize the formal qualities. This is a combination of analysis and creative projection and serves as a bridge to interpretation. Utterance example: They look like zooming fireballs. Questioning example: What is the intended impact of the formal analysis on your emotions? Feedback example: You can use metaphor, mimesis, and anthropomorphism.	Step explanation: Interpretation brings personal associative experience that analyzing content, form, and character, to find out intentional meaning beyond surface. Interpretation tells us what the object means, answering the question; what is this work all about? Since interpretation is creative activity, multiple interpretations should be included in interactive educational critiques. Utterance example: It was the artist’s attempt to make a picture of a twisty, a tangled rainbow. Questioning example: What do you think this work means? Feedback example: Every interpretive statement should be guided by the fully developed driving pervasive quality and funded by the objective visual facts contained within the work. Check your interpretation is based on visual properties.	Step explanation: Provides added perspective on the circumstances of the work (who, what, when, where, why, and how surrounding the work). Contextual description is focused on the artist’s life and intentions; the circumstances of the making of the work; the function or the functions of the work; and its place in society—its symbolic meanings, its reflection of beliefs, and so on. If a work is remote to students either culturally or in time, it may be better to start with the contextual examination. Questioning example: Who did the work? Feedback example: Let’s find the information about the work, social, political, religious, and economic nature of the artist’s world and how these factors influence the artist’s role in that world.	Step explanation: Resolving personal or interactively developed interpretations with those of the experts as determined in the contextual examination. Students who can substantiate an argument for meaning that runs counter to the experts’, or even the artist’s, and can point to visual evidence, must be respected for their positions. This is an appropriate time for a teacher to introduce aesthetic theory, in this case, issues revolving around artistic intentionalism. Questioning example: Is artist the final word on meaning in artworks? Feedback example: You can briefly restate personal interpretations, and then salient points of expert opinion. The next operation is to try to reconcile personal and expert views by discussing how you agree or overlap and to note where you disagree.	Step explanation: Theories such as formalism, expressionism, mimesis, pragmatism, and conceptualism should be brought to bear on making a summative judgment of an artwork. It is appropriate to evaluate the experience of encountering the work. Evaluation tells us what the object is worth. Utterance example: It’s a bad painting because you just can’t figure out what it looks like. Questioning example: What was the quality of your experience in critiquing this work? Feedback example: How about making an evaluation of the expressive content of the work in relation to personal and social values.
Step explanation: Initial, general, global, intuitive, evaluative response. Utterance example: Wow! That’s bright! Makes me think of the Big Apple. Questioning example: How does this work of art make you feel? Feedback example: That’s very good.	Step explanation: Obvious thematic, formal, and technical. Description tells us what an object is and what it is for. Begin with obvious features, such as representational and illusional qualities. Utterance example: This is a picture of birds and fish metamorphosing into each other. Questioning example: And the orange thing is the cloud.What’s going on? Feedback example: If the work is very abstract, it is better to venture a guess than to describe it as having no denotative content.	Step explanation: Look for formal relationships between forms and images. Differences such as changes in rhythm or one thing’s being bigger, darker, brighter than another are particularly significant clues for meaning. Focus on principles of design: unity, variety, focus, rhythm and so on. Questioning example: What strikes you as formally significant in the work? Feedback example: You don’t have to look for every formal quality randomly and exhaustively, but only for those most salient clues suggested by interest.	Step explanation: Intended impact of the forms, colors, theme, and their relationships. Characterize the formal qualities. This is a combination of analysis and creative projection and serves as a bridge to interpretation. Utterance example: They look like zooming fireballs. Questioning example: What is the intended impact of the formal analysis on your emotions? Feedback example: Stylistic categorizations may be broad as realist, formalist, expressionist, fantastic, and instrumental, or as specific as Abstract Expressionism, Process Art, or Impressionism.	Step explanation: Interpretation brings personal associative experience that analyzing content, form, and character, to find out intentional meaning beyond surface. Interpretation tells us what the object means, answering the question; what is this work all about? Since interpretation is creative activity, multiple interpretations should be included in interactive educational critiques. Utterance example: It was the artist’s attempt to make a picture of a twisty, a tangled rainbow. Questioning example: What do you think this work means? Feedback example: Let’s use as rich and as fully developed language as you have to convey the mature emotional and cognitive meaning evoked by the work.	Step explanation: Provides added perspective on the circumstances of the work (who, what, when, where, why, and how surrounding the work). Contextual description is focused on the artist’s life and intentions; the circumstances of the making of the work; the function or the functions of the work; and its place in society—its symbolic meanings, its reflection of beliefs, and so on. If a work is remote to students either culturally or in time, it may be better to start with the contextual examination. Questioning example: What is the title? Feedback example: Let’s find the information about the work, social, political, religious, and economic nature of the artist’s world and how these factors influence the artist’s role in that world.	Step explanation: Resolving personal or interactively developed interpretations with those of the experts as determined in the contextual examination. Students who can substantiate an argument for meaning that runs counter to the experts’, or even the artist’s, and can point to visual evidence, must be respected for their positions. This is an appropriate time for a teacher to introduce aesthetic theory, in this case, issues revolving around artistic intentionalism. Questioning example: Is artist the final word on meaning in artworks? Feedback example: It’s perfectly acceptable for the viewer to disagree with expert opinion at this point.	Step explanation: Theories such as formalism, expressionism, mimesis, pragmatism, and conceptualism should be brought to bear on making a summative judgment of an artwork. It is appropriate to evaluate the experience of encountering the work. Evaluation tells us what the object is worth. Utterance example: It’s a bad painting because you just can’t figure out what it looks like. Questioning example: What was the quality of your experience in critiquing this work? Feedback example: Your evaluation may include your personal experience, in light of expert opinion, and finally an evaluation of the work in question in light of all that has been learned.

Description tells us what an object is and what it is for. Begin with obvious features, such as representational and illusional qualities. Utterance example: This is a picture of birds and fish metamorphosing into each other. Questioning example: And the orange thing is the cloud.What’s going on? Feedback example: What else do you see?	Step explanation: Look for formal relationships between forms and images. Differences such as changes in rhythm or one thing’s being bigger, darker, brighter than another are particularly significant clues for meaning. Focus on principles of design: unity, variety, focus, rhythm and so on. Questioning example: What strikes you as formally significant in the work? Feedback example: Let’s focus on seeing the pattern, then to see its parts and how they contribute to the whole and ultimately to the thematic content and overall expressive purpose of the work.	Step explanation: Intended impact of the forms, colors, theme, and their relationships. Characterize the formal qualities. This is a combination of analysis and creative projection and serves as a bridge to interpretation. Utterance example: They look like zooming fireballs. Questioning example: What is the intended impact of the formal analysis on your emotions? Feedback example: Why did you think so?	Step explanation: Interpretation brings personal associative experience that analyzing content, form, and character, to find out intentional meaning beyond surface.

Contextual description is focused on the artist’s life and intentions; the circumstances of the making of the work; the function or the functions of the work; and its place in society—its symbolic meanings, its reflection of beliefs, and so on. If a work is remote to students either culturally or in time, it may be better to start with the contextual examination. Questioning example: Why did the artist paint this? What is the purpose of this work? Feedback example: Let’s find the information about the work, social, political, religious, and economic nature of the artist’s world and how these factors influence the artist’s role in that world.	Step explanation: Resolving personal or interactively developed interpretations with those of the experts as determined in the contextual examination. Students who can substantiate an argument for meaning that runs counter to the experts’, or even the artist’s, and can point to visual evidence, must be respected for their positions. This is an appropriate time for a teacher to introduce aesthetic theory, in this case, issues revolving around artistic intentionalism. Questioning example: Does the artist have more right to determine meaning than the educated viewer? Feedback example: You can briefly restate personal interpretations, and then salient points of expert opinion. The next operation is to try to reconcile personal and expert views by discussing how you agree or overlap and to note where you disagree.	Step explanation: Theories such as formalism, expressionism, mimesis, pragmatism, and conceptualism should be brought to bear on making a summative judgment of an artwork.

Questioning example: If you are inside the work, as a particular character, abstract form, or figure, what would you be thinking and feeling? Feedback example: That’s a really great opinion.	Step explanation: Provides added perspective on the circumstances of the work (who, what, when, where, why, and how surrounding the work). Contextual description is focused on the artist’s life and intentions; the circumstances of the making of the work; the function or the functions of the work; and its place in society—its symbolic meanings, its reflection of beliefs, and so on. If a work is remote to students either culturally or in time, it may be better to start with the contextual examination. Questioning example: What materials were available to the artist? Feedback example: Let’s find the information about the work, social, political, religious, and economic nature of the artist’s world and how these factors influence the artist’s role in that world.	Step explanation: Resolving personal or interactively developed interpretations with those of the experts as determined in the contextual examination. Students who can substantiate an argument for meaning that runs counter to the experts’, or even the artist’s, and can point to visual evidence, must be respected for their positions. This is an appropriate time for a teacher to introduce aesthetic theory, in this case, issues revolving around artistic intentionalism. Questioning example: What is there about this work that is significant to me, and why? Feedback example: You can briefly restate personal interpretations, and then salient points of expert opinion. The next operation is to try to reconcile personal and expert views by discussing how you agree or overlap and to note where you disagree.	Step explanation: Theories such as formalism, expressionism, mimesis, pragmatism, and conceptualism should be brought to bear on making a summative judgment of an artwork. It is appropriate to evaluate the experience of encountering the work. Evaluation tells us what the object is worth. Utterance example: It’s a bad painting because you just can’t figure out what it looks like. Questioning example: Have your perceptions or feelings changed since we started? How? Feedback example: That’s a really great opinion.
Step explanation: Initial, general, global, intuitive, evaluative response. Utterance example: Wow! That’s bright! Makes me think of the Big Apple. Questioning example: What do you think about what you see? Feedback example: That’s very good.	Step explanation: Obvious thematic, formal, and technical. Description tells us what an object is and what it is for. Begin with obvious features, such as representational and illusional qualities. Utterance example: This is a picture of birds and fish metamorphosing into each other. Questioning example: What images(illusions, pictures of recognizable things) do you see? Feedback example: Let’s begin with general statements of obvious thematic content and then work to the specifics of detail and form.	Step explanation: Look for formal relationships between forms and images. Differences such as changes in rhythm or one thing’s being bigger, darker, brighter than another are particularly significant clues for meaning. Focus on principles of design: unity, variety, focus, rhythm and so on. Questioning example: What strikes you as formally significant in the work? Feedback example: What is the effect?	Step explanation: Intended impact of the forms, colors, theme, and their relationships. Characterize the formal qualities. This is a combination of analysis and creative projection and serves as a bridge to interpretation. Utterance example: They look like zooming fireballs. Questioning example: What mood is presented? How are we meant to feel in the presence of this piece? Why? What’s the evidence? Feedback example: You can use metaphor, mimesis, and anthropomorphism.	Step explanation: Interpretation brings personal associative experience that analyzing content, form, and character, to find out intentional meaning beyond surface. Interpretation tells us what the object means, answering the question; what is this work all about? Since interpretation is creative activity, multiple interpretations should be included in interactive educational critiques. Utterance example: It was the artist’s attempt to make a picture of a twisty, a tangled rainbow. Questioning example: If you are inside the work, as a particular character, abstract form, or figure, what would you be thinking and feeling? Feedback example: Make a claim about your topic: Claim – An explanation or interpretation of some aspect of the artwork	Step explanation: Provides added perspective on the circumstances of the work (who, what, when, where, why, and how surrounding the work). Contextual description is focused on the artist’s life and intentions; the circumstances of the making of the work; the function or the functions of the work; and its place in society—its symbolic meanings, its reflection of beliefs, and so on. If a work is remote to students either culturally or in time, it may be better to start with the contextual examination. Questioning example: What were the basic artistic assumptions and restrictions? Feedback example: Let’s find the information about the work, social, political, religious, and economic nature of the artist’s world and how these factors influence the artist’s role in that world.	Step explanation: Resolving personal or interactively developed interpretations with those of the experts as determined in the contextual examination. Students who can substantiate an argument for meaning that runs counter to the experts’, or even the artist’s, and can point to visual evidence, must be respected for their positions. This is an appropriate time for a teacher to introduce aesthetic theory, in this case, issues revolving around artistic intentionalism. Questioning example: What is there about this work that is significant to me, and why? Feedback example: It’s perfectly acceptable for the viewer to disagree with expert opinion at this point.	Step explanation: Theories such as formalism, expressionism, mimesis, pragmatism, and conceptualism should be brought to bear on making a summative judgment of an artwork. It is appropriate to evaluate the experience of encountering the work. Evaluation tells us what the object is worth. Utterance example: It’s a bad painting because you just can’t figure out what it looks like. Questioning example: Is there any difference after appreciating this art? Feedback example: How about making an evaluation of the expressive content of the work in relation to personal and social values.
Step explanation: Initial, general, global, intuitive, evaluative response. Utterance example: Wow! That’s bright! Makes me think of the Big Apple. Questioning example: What do you think about what you see? Feedback example: Where (or what) did you see that made you think that?	Step explanation: Obvious thematic, formal, and technical. Description tells us what an object is and what it is for. Begin with obvious features, such as representational and illusional qualities. Utterance example: This is a picture of birds and fish metamorphosing into each other. Questioning example: What images(illusions, pictures of recognizable things) do you see? Feedback example: If the work is very abstract, it is better to venture a guess than to describe it as having no denotative content.	Step explanation: Look for formal relationships between forms and images. Differences such as changes in rhythm or one thing’s being bigger, darker, brighter than another are particularly significant clues for meaning. Focus on principles of design: unity, variety, focus, rhythm and so on. Questioning example: What(colors, shapes, textures, lines) dominate the image? Why? Feedback example: Art works are all of a piece. There are no parts in an artwork that do not count, all forms and relationships have expressive significance. So let’s attempt to impart meaning to these forms in the same holistic spirit in which they were constructed.	Step explanation: Intended impact of the forms, colors, theme, and their relationships. Characterize the formal qualities. This is a combination of analysis and creative projection and serves as a bridge to interpretation. Utterance example: They look like zooming fireballs. Questioning example: What mood is presented? How are we meant to feel in the presence of this piece? Why? What’s the evidence? Feedback example: Stylistic categorizations may be broad as realist, formalist, expressionist, fantastic, and instrumental, or as specific as Abstract Expressionism, Process Art, or Impressionism.	Step explanation: Interpretation brings personal associative experience that analyzing content, form, and character, to find out intentional meaning beyond surface. Interpretation tells us what the object means, answering the question; what is this work all about? Since interpretation is creative activity, multiple interpretations should be included in interactive educational critiques. Utterance example: It was the artist’s attempt to make a picture of a twisty, a tangled rainbow. Questioning example: If you are inside the work, as a particular character, abstract form, or figure, what would you be thinking and feeling? Feedback example: Identify support for your claim: Support – Thing you see, feel and know about your claim	Step explanation: Provides added perspective on the circumstances of the work (who, what, when, where, why, and how surrounding the work). Contextual description is focused on the artist’s life and intentions; the circumstances of the making of the work; the function or the functions of the work; and its place in society—its symbolic meanings, its reflection of beliefs, and so on. If a work is remote to students either culturally or in time, it may be better to start with the contextual examination. Questioning example: Was the artist an advocate of the system or a rebel, an innovator or a synthesizer, a spiritualist or a pragmatist? Feedback example: Let’s find the information about the work, social, political, religious, and economic nature of the artist’s world and how these factors influence the artist’s role in that world.		Step explanation: Theories such as formalism, expressionism, mimesis, pragmatism, and conceptualism should be brought to bear on making a summative judgment of an artwork. It is appropriate to evaluate the experience of encountering the work. Evaluation tells us what the object is worth. Utterance example: It’s a bad painting because you just can’t figure out what it looks like. Questioning example: Is there any difference after appreciating this art?

Characterize the formal qualities. This is a combination of analysis and creative projection and serves as a bridge to interpretation. Utterance example: It looks like blasting heads of fire. Questioning example: What is the intended impact of the formal analysis on your emotions? Feedback example: You can use metaphor, mimesis, and anthropomorphism.	Step explanation: Interpretation brings personal associative experience that analyzing content, form, and character, to find out intentional meaning beyond surface. Interpretation tells us what the object means, answering the question; what is this work all about? Since interpretation is creative activity, multiple interpretations should be included in interactive educational critiques. Utterance example: It was the artist’s attempt to make a picture of a twisty, a tangled rainbow. Questioning example: What would it be like to be sitting on the hillside shown in this painting? Feedback example: Every interpretive statement should be guided by the fully developed driving pervasive quality and funded by the objective visual facts contained within the work. Check your interpretation is based on visual properties.			Step explanation: Theories such as formalism, expressionism, mimesis, pragmatism, and conceptualism should be brought to bear on making a summative judgment of an artwork. It is appropriate to evaluate the experience of encountering the work. Evaluation tells us what the object is worth. Utterance example: It’s a bad painting because you just can’t figure out what it looks like. Questioning example: Is this artwork important in society? Feedback example: How about making an evaluation of the expressive content of the work in relation to personal and social values.
Step explanation: Initial, general, global, intuitive, evaluative response. Utterance example: Hmmm. I don’t get much from that. Kind of blah. Questioning example: What do you see? Feedback example: It's impressive how well you express your feelings in writing.	Step explanation: Obvious thematic, formal, and technical. Description tells us what an object is and what it is for. Begin with obvious features, such as representational and illusional qualities. Utterance example: This is a picture of birds and fish metamorphosing into each other. Questioning example: Are there any outstanding or unusual features you notice? Feedback example: What more can you find?	Step explanation: Look for formal relationships between forms and images. Differences such as changes in rhythm or one thing’s being bigger, darker, brighter than another are particularly significant clues for meaning. Focus on principles of design: unity, variety, focus, rhythm and so on. Questioning example: What movement do you see? What elements(line, shape, etc.) and principles(rhythm, proportion, etc.) cause movement? Feedback example: You don’t have to look for every formal quality randomly and exhaustively, but only for those most salient clues suggested by interest.

Feedback example: Your evaluation may include your personal experience, in light of expert opinion, and finally an evaluation of the work in question in light of all that has been learned.
Step explanation: Initial, general, global, intuitive, evaluative response. Utterance example: It feels sterile, it reminds me of Indiana. Questioning example: What do you think about what you see? Feedback example: Let’s avoid the words “good” and “bad” in expressing since normative judgments are premature at this point.	Step explanation: Obvious thematic, formal, and technical. Description tells us what an object is and what it is for. Begin with obvious features, such as representational and illusional qualities. Utterance example: This is a picture of birds and fish metamorphosing into each other. Questioning example: What can you say is the characteristic of this work? Feedback example: Yes, they look like they are fighting, but no it’s not a crab and it’s not a raccoon. Can you guess it again?	Step explanation: Look for formal relationships between forms and images. Differences such as changes in rhythm or one thing’s being bigger, darker, brighter than another are particularly significant clues for meaning. Focus on principles of design: unity, variety, focus, rhythm and so on. Questioning example: What are its pieces, components? Feedback example: Art works are all of a piece. There are no parts in an artwork that do not count, all forms and relationships have expressive significance. So let’s attempt to impart meaning to these forms in the same holistic spirit in which they were constructed.	Step explanation: Intended impact of the forms, colors, theme, and their relationships. Characterize the formal qualities. This is a combination of analysis and creative projection and serves as a bridge to interpretation. Utterance example: It looks like syncopated light blips moving in a gridlock, setting the stage very well for mature interpretation. Questioning example: To which stylistic category does this work belong? Feedback example: Why did you think so?	Step explanation: Interpretation brings personal associative experience that analyzing content, form, and character, to find out intentional meaning beyond surface. Interpretation tells us what the object means, answering the question; what is this work all about? Since interpretation is creative activity, multiple interpretations should be included in interactive educational critiques. Utterance example: I think the women in the painting are waiting for the boss. Maybe the boss told them to sit there and maybe he's walking Questioning example: If you are inside the work, as a particular character, abstract form, or figure, what would you be thinking and feeling?

He has more than just an ordinary eye. A mountainside to you and I look like an eagle spreading his wings to him. Only Rene Magritte would draw a painting of a painting of a scene. What other artis would draw a woman in a peach or a man thinking of an apple. Rene Magritte sees the world with a different eye. Questioning example: Does it seem “right” in terms of color, composition, and so on? Feedback example: How about making an evaluation of the expressive content of the work in relation to personal and social values.
