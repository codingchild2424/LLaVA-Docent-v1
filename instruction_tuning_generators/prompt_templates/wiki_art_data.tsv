1	Western Medieval Art	St. Vitalis, Archangel, Jesus Christ, Second Archangel and Bishop of Ravenna Ecclesius	Byzantine Mosaics	547	: Byzantine, Early Byzantine (c. 330–750)	mosaic	Christ sits on a globe representing the universe. Except for a bit of shadow at his feet, he does not seem to be relying on the globe for support. He wears a toga with two vertical stripes, as do the archangels beside him. With his left hand, he holds a scroll with seven seals. Thus, with his other hand, Christ gives a martyr's crown to St. Vitalis. To receive the crown, Vitalis has covered his hands with a cloth, as in Byzantine court ceremonies. He wears boots to show he was a soldier, whereas Christ and his angels wear sandals. The angels carry narrow sceptres in the hands closer to Christ. With their other hands they present Vitalis and Ecclesius to Christ. They could possibly be identified as Michael and Gabriel, who sometimes flank important figures in images of this period.
2	Western Renaissance Art	Children’s Games	Pieter Bruegel the Elder	1560	Northern Renaissance	oil on panel	From a bird’s-eye view – the only way Bruegel could legibly fit in the impressive number of figures – the viewer looks down onto a wide square with a transition from an urban to a rural setting at the edges. On the right the view opens on to a long street laid out in central perspective and leading to the city centre, where a church steeple (or town-hall tower) soars into the sky. The battlement-crowned building at the edge of the square towards the city opens into an arcade running parallel to the course of the stream. At the left edge of the painting, an idyllic village appears on the horizon. Children – more than 230 in all – are occupied with 83 different games. The whole city seems to be theirs. Bruegel gives the beholder an encyclopaedic view of the children’s games of his time. The tininess of the figures and scenes forces a viewer seeking to decipher all the games to study the individual parts of the painting slowly and minutely – an entertaining pastime. However, some modern scholars have refused to accept such a humanistic-oriented, “simple” interpretation: the seemingly useless children’s activities have been regarded – probably incorrectly – as a parable forthe senselessness and foolishness of human behaviour.
3	Western Renaissance Art	Sistine Chapel Ceiling: Creation of Adam	Michelangelo	1510	High Renaissance	fresco	The Creation of Adam (Italian: Creazione di Adamo) is a fresco painting by Italian artist Michelangelo, which forms part of the Sistine Chapel's ceiling, painted c. 1508–1512. It illustrates the Biblical creation narrative from the Book of Genesis in which God gives life to Adam, the first man. The fresco is part of a complex iconographic scheme and is chronologically the fourth in the series of panels depicting episodes from Genesis. The image of the near-touching hands of God and Adam has become iconic of humanity. The painting has been reproduced in countless imitations and parodies. Michelangelo's Creation of Adam is one of the most replicated religious paintings of all time.
4	Western Renaissance Art	Primavera(The Spring)	Sandro Botticelli	1482	Early Renaissance	tempera on panel 	 Probably based on a theme suggested by Poliziano, it depicts a symbolic and allegorical subject with a complex interpretation: the Realm of Venus. Zephyr chases the nymph Chloris, who turns into the goddess Flora at right. In the center of the painting is Venus, goddess of sacred love, leaning against a myrtle bush, the sacred plant that symbolizes her. Above her, Cupid flies high, blindfolded. His wings come out of the painting, he launches a fiery arrow towards the Three Graces, the three successive figures of the work, intent in a dance in a circle. The last character, on the left, is Mercury, the messenger god, which can be recognized by the winged shoes and the petasus, the typically pointed hat of travelers. The god, with his rod, the caduceus, keeps away the clouds that threaten this ideal and eternal garden, where everything is a harmony of forms and feelings, a perfect microcosm, mirror of a universal macrocosm.
5	Western Renaissance Art	Summer	Giuseppe Arcimboldo	1563	Mannerism (Late Renaissance)	oil, canvas	Arcimboldo made many renditions as himself of the fours seasons, with winter being dry broken twigs and rock, spring full of flowers and new growth, summer full of fresh and fully ripe fruits and vegetables, and autumn being images of the harvest. Perhaps the fruity images of summer are best known. 
6	Western Renaissance Art	The Arnolfini Wedding. Portrait of Giovanni Arnolfini and his Wife Giovanna Cenami (The Arnolfini Marriage)	Jan van Eyck	1434	Northern Renaissance	oil on panel	It is considered one of the most original and complex paintings in Western art, because of its beauty, complex iconography, geometric orthogonal perspective, and expansion of the picture space with the use of a mirror. The portrait has been considered as a unique form of marriage contract, recorded as a painting. Objects scattered around the room seem to indicate the couple's relationship. The duster brush hanging on the bed frame represents women's domestic duties, and the statue above the bed frame is thought to be Saint Margaret, the patron saint of childbirth. In this work, Van Eyck showed an amazing ability to describe parts and express light. An elaborate mirror with scenes from the Passion of Jesus on its edges reflects the couple's back, along with two other people standing in the foyer. One of them appears to be Van Eyck, wearing a red turban.
7	Western Post Renaissance Art	The Nightwatch	Rembrandt	1642	Baroque, Tenebrism	oil, canvas	The Night Watch is one of the most famous Dutch Golden Age paintings. The painting is famous for three things: its colossal size, the dramatic use of light and shadow (tenebrism) and the perception of motion in what would have traditionally been a static military group portrait. The painting was completed in 1642, at the peak of the Dutch Golden Age. It depicts the eponymous company moving out, led by Captain Frans Banning Cocq (dressed in black, with a red sash) and his lieutenant, Willem van Ruytenburch (dressed in yellow, with a white sash). With effective use of sunlight and shade, Rembrandt leads the eye to the three most important characters among the crowd: the two gentlemen in the centre (from whom the painting gets its original title), and the woman in the centre-left background carrying a chicken. Behind them, the company's colours are carried by the ensign, Jan Visscher Cornelissen. The figures are almost life-size.
8	Western Post Renaissance Art	Las Meninas	Diego Velazquez	1656	Baroque	oil, canvas	Las Meninas(Spanish for The Ladies-in-waiting) is a 1656 painting in the Museo del Prado in Madrid, by Diego Velázquez, the leading artist of the Spanish Golden Age. Its complex and enigmatic composition raises questions about reality and illusion, and creates an uncertain relationship between the viewer and the figures depicted. Because of these complexities, Las Meninas has been one of the most widely analyzed works in Western painting. The painting shows a large room in the Royal Alcazar of Madrid during the reign of King Philip IV of Spain, and presents several figures, most identifiable from the Spanish court, captured, according to some commentators, in a particular moment as if in a snapshot. Some look out of the canvas towards the viewer, while others interact among themselves. The young Infanta Margaret Theresa is surrounded by her entourage of maids of honour, chaperone, bodyguard, two dwarfs and a dog. Just behind them, Velázquez portrays himself working at a large canvas. Velázquez looks outwards, beyond the pictorial space to where a viewer of the painting would stand. In the background there is a mirror that reflects the upper bodies of the king and queen. They appear to be placed outside the picture space in a position similar to that of the viewer, although some scholars have speculated that their image is a reflection from the painting Velázquez is shown working on.
9	Western Post Renaissance Art	Courtyard of a house in Delft	Pieter de Hooch	1658	Baroque	oil, canvas	This is a masterpiece of clear and direct depiction of domestic architecture typical of de Hooch's middle period. There are some subtle effects that are at variance with the overall impression of harmony. The brickwork of the wall on the right is in a sad state compared to the house on the left; there is an interesting double perspective that differentiates the two halves that are divided by the right edge of the archway and building above. Nature is making incursions to the well swept courtyard from the plant border on the right, the shrub above the couple's head and the vine obscuring the stone tablet. On the left of a courtyard is a porch built of red brick and stone, with an inscription let into the wall above. A woman, with her back to the spectator, stands in full light within the passage. To the right of the porch is a high fence with a vine growing over it ; there is an open door in the wall to the right, from which a few steps lead down into the paved courtyard. A woman carrying a dish in her left hand descends the steps, holding a little girl by her right hand. In the right foreground are a pail and a broom.
10	Western Post Renaissance Art	The Girl with a Pearl Earring	Johannes Vermeer	1665	Baroque	oil, canvas	The identity of the model in The Girl with a Pearl Earring remains unknown. Some have suggested that it is Vermeer’s eldest daughter, Maria, however there is no compelling evidence to confirm this assertion. It depicts a European girl wearing an exotic dress, an oriental turban, and an improbably large pearl earring. The model is set against a dark background and has a sense of immediacy and drama. The painting has a timeless quality, the girl bears no symbolic attributes, and she is not placed in any specific context. For this reason, she has captured the imagination of viewers throughout generations.
11	Western Post Renaissance Art	The Swing	Jean-Honore Fragonard	1767	Rococo	oil, canvas	Also know as The Happy Accidents of the Swing, this painting is considered one of the great master works of the Rococo era. The picture depicts a young woman on a tree swing, being pushed by her husband. The young woman is clearly flirting with the young man in the foreground, of whom her husband is unaware. The painting was first commissioned to Gabriel Francois Doyen by a young nobleman, to depict him and his mistress. Doyen, of the opinion that the painting was frivolous, refused the commission and passed it on to Fragonard. This painting has influences many later works, from paintings to sculptures, the most recent being the animated feature film Tangled, created in the style of the painting.
12	Western Post Renaissance Art	Gilles	Antoine Watteau	1719	Rococo	oil, canvas	Painted in 1718-1719, this large painting is a major oeuvre by Antoine Watteau. It features a Pierrot, standing and dressed all in white. His dreamy expression challenges the viewer, raising questions about what he might be thinking. Behind the mound of earth on which Pierrot stands are other commedia dell'arte characters, Pierrot's companions: the doctor on his donkey, the lovers Leandro and Isabella, and the captain.
13	Western Post Renaissance Art	The Young Schoolmistress	Jean-Baptiste-Simeon Chardin	1740	Rococo	oil, canvas	A young child is being taught by an older girl, perhaps in her early teens, who is possibly an elder sister or another relation such as a cousin. Despite the picture’s title, this is a private lesson, probably taking place at home rather than at school. The younger child is most likely a boy, although we cannot be entirely sure. The chidren appear to be from a middle-class family, which is well provided for but not ostentatiously wealthy. They belong, perhaps, to the growing French bourgeoisie that particularly admired Chardin’s pictures, which they often knew and owned as engravings of the original paintings. This class particularly valued education, especially literacy, which was no longer confined to the nobility and professional classes.
14	Western Post Renaissance Art	Girl with Racket and Shuttlecock	Jean-Baptiste-Simeon Chardin	1740	Rococo	oil, canvas	Chardin's technique of using paint to create effects similar to pastel and his interest in formal elements (composition, color, texture) are the most noteworthy aspects of this painting. Nothing dramatic happens in this painting, which shows a girl dazedly playing with a badminton racket and a shuttlecock. The girl actually looks bored, as if she is ready to play badminton and waiting for her opponent, but the interaction between soft colors and the surface of the painting is fascinating. The blush on the girl's cheeks, the velvety fabric, and the billowing skirt contrast sharply with the space surrounding her and the wood of the racket and chair, while also harmonizing perfectly.
15	Western Post Renaissance Art	The Guitarist	Jean-Baptiste Greuze	1757	Rococo	oil, canvas	French artist Jean-Baptiste Greuze, produced the painting during his stay in Rome. It shows a young man tuning a guitar, with hunting accessories in the left background symbolising his being a bird-hunter (a common symbol for a seducer)
16	Western Post Renaissance Art	Madame de Pompadour	Francois Boucher	1756	Rococo	oil, canvas	Madame de Pompadour was the official mistress of King Louis XV of France. She gained considerable influence and advised the king in political matters, too. François Boucher presents her in an elaborately embellished afternoon dress. She is surrounded by books, correspondence, sheets of music and drawing utensil. The sitter herself, who commissioned the picture, wanted to be perceived as a beautiful and educated woman.
17	Western Post Renaissance Art	Liberty Leading the People	Eugene Delacroix	1830	Romanticism	oil, canvas	Painted by Eugene Delacroix commemorating the July Revolution of 1830, which toppled King Charles X. A woman of the people with a Phrygian cap personifying the concept of Liberty leads a varied group of people forward over a barricade and the bodies of the fallen, holding aloft the flag of the French Revolution – the tricolour, which again became France's national flag after these events – in one hand and brandishing a bayonetted musket with the other. The figure of Liberty is also viewed as a symbol of France and the French Republic known as Marianne. The tricolor flag was placed in three places. One is in the goddess hands, another is the man's red belt, white underwear, and blue shirt, and the other is a tricolor flag at the top of Notre Dame in the distance.
18	Western Post Renaissance Art	The Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog	Caspar David Friedrich	1818	Romanticism	oil, canvas	The painting is also known as Wanderer above the Mist or Mountaineer in a Misty Landscape. It has been considered one of the masterpieces of Romanticism and one of its most representative works. In the foreground, a young man stands upon a rocky precipice with his back to the viewer. He is wrapped in a dark green overcoat, and grips a walking stick in his right hand. His hair caught in a wind, the wanderer gazes out on a landscape covered in a thick sea of fog. In the middle ground, several other ridges, perhaps not unlike the ones the wanderer himself stands upon, jut out from the mass. Through the wreaths of fog, forests of trees can be perceived atop these escarpments. In the far distance, faded mountains rise in the left, gently leveling off into lowland plains in the east. Beyond here, the pervading fog stretches out indefinitely, eventually commingling with the horizon and becoming indistinguishable from the cloud-filled sky.
19	Western Post Renaissance Art	The Third of May 1808 (Execution of the Defenders of Madrid)	Francisco Goya	1814	Romanticism	oil, canvas	This painting was commissioned by the provisional government of Spain, upon Goya’s suggestion, to commemorate the invasion of Spain by Napoleon’s troops in 1808. At the time it was painted, the painting was considered groundbreaking and revolutionary, as it presents the horrors of war that had heretofore not been openly illustrated. The painting focuses on one man, illuminated in white light in the middle of the painting, arms held out to the sides, facing a French firing squad. His slain companions litter the ground. It is thus considered one of the first pieces of modern art. This painting has influenced many other artists, who have directly referenced the style and setting of the painting, including Edouard Manet and Pablo Picasso.
20	Western Post Renaissance Art	The Raft of the Medusa	Théodore Géricault	1819	Romanticism, Realism	oil, canvas	The epic painting The Raft of the Medusa features a gruesome mass of figures afloat at sea, some dead, some struggling for life, in a tangled mass positioned on a crudely-made raft. The only African figure on the raft waves a cloth at the top of a pile of a few men who are struggling to get the attention of a ship in the distance (located on the far right of the horizon line). The sail of the raft is billowing in the wind while being tossed about a choppy ocean beneath a stormy sky. The subject depicted is the artist's dramatic interpretation of the events beginning on July 2, 1816, when a French navy frigate crashed on its way to colonies in West Africa. The appointed governor of the colony and the top-ranking officers in the party left on the ship's six lifeboats leaving the remaining 147 passengers to be crowded onto a hastily made raft. When the raft proved too cumbersome, in a horrific act of cowardice and fear, the ship's leader cut the ropes to the raft. Left to fend for themselves for 13 days, the passengers eventually resorted to cannibalism. When rescued by a passing British ship, only 15 men were left alive, of whom 5 died before they were able to reach land. When the public learned of this, it became an international tragedy and a searing indictment of the current French government.
21	Western Post Renaissance Art	Lion a Newfoundland Dog	Edwin Henry Landseer	1824	Romanticism	oil, canvas	The Newfoundland is a large Canadian working dog, capable of drawing a sledge, and celebrated for its intelligence, docility and swimming power. The dog's owner, W. H. de Merle, commissioned this painting. The artist based the background on landscape seen in Scotland.
22	Western Post Renaissance Art	The Stages of Life	Caspar David Friedrich	1835	Romanticism	oil, canvas	The painting is set on a sea shore and shows in the foreground an aged man with his back turned to the viewer, walking towards two adults and two children on a hilltop overlooking a harbour. The figures are echoed by five ships shown in the harbour, each at a different distance from the shore, an allegorical reference to the different stages of human life, to the end of a journey, to the closeness of death. These five figures correspond to the five ships visible in the harbour beyond. The three groupings of figures (one aged man, two adults, and two children) echo the positioning of the ships at various distances from the shore as allegorical of the stages of life, and closeness to death. The central ship is thought to represent the mother, while further inshore, two small boats—references to the two children—have only just begun their voyage and still remain in shallow, clear water. To the horizon, the farthest ship disappears into the setting horizon, symbolizing the aged man's voyage from this life into the unknown.
23	Western Post Renaissance Art	Fur Traders Descending the Missouri	George Caleb Bingham	1845	Romanticism, Naïve Art (Primitivism)	oil, canvas	It reflects the reality of fur traders' common marriages with Native American women, which resulted in the formation of the Métis ethnic group in Canada. The father's toque cap suggests that he is a voyageur of French descent. A black fox is in the front of the canoe, with pointed ears, long, sharp snout, and tongue. Black fox pelts were the most expensive, and therefore most desirable, furs of the time. Many Native American tribes regarded black foxes as spiritually symbolic creatures. Although it may seem at odds with the rough content of the painting, Bingham uses graceful, skillful brushstrokes, surprising geometric compositions, and bright, pure light to depict the pioneers and people who made their home on the river, who took risky adventures to create a new world. It revealed a harsh life.
24	Western Post Renaissance Art	Ophelia	John Everett Millais	1852	Romanticism	oil, canvas	The painting depicts Ophelia singing while floating in a river just before she drowns. The scene is described in Act IV, Scene VII of Hamlet in a speech by Queen Gertrude. The episode depicted is not seen onstage, but exists only in Gertrude's description. Ophelia has fallen into the river from a tree overhanging it, while gathering flowers. She lies in the water singing songs, as if unaware of her danger ("incapable of her own distress"). Her clothes, trapping air, have allowed her to temporarily stay afloat ("Her clothes spread wide, / And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up."). But eventually, "her garments, heavy with their drink, / Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay" down "to muddy death".
25	Western Post Renaissance Art	The Sower	Jean-Francois Millet	1850	Realism	oil, canvas	With a bag of seed slung over his shoulder and his legs wrapped in straw for warmth, Millet’s peasant strides down a twilit hillside, sowing winter wheat. In the background, an ox-drawn harrow covers the sown seed with soil. The sower’s monumental scale and dramatic pose signaled Millet’s new approach to the depiction of peasant life, emphasizing the dignity—even heroism—of rural labor. This ennobling of the sower echoed the recent enfranchisement of male agricultural workers in the wake of the 1848 French Revolution. For his 19th-century viewers, Millet’s rough and broad execution evoked the rustic land itself; the peasant, observed one critic, “seems painted with the earth that he sows.” This idea especially resonated with Vincent van Gogh, who considered Millet “that essential modern painter who opened the horizon to many.”
26	Western Post Renaissance Art	The Scapegoat	William Holman Hunt	1856	Romanticism, Orientalism	oil, canvas	The Scapegoat depicts the "scapegoat" described in the Book of Leviticus. On the Day of Atonement, a goat would have its horns wrapped with a red cloth - representing the sins of the community - and be driven off. This ritual can also be seen as an echo of Jesus' sacrifice, and to further emphasize this meaning, a red ribbon symbolizing a crown was attached to the goat's horns. The holiness of this ritual was emphasized by the moon shining on the left side of the painting, surrounding the goat's horns like a halo. He started painting on the shore of the Dead Sea and continued in his studio in London. The painting was the only major work completed by Hunt during his first trip to the Holy Land, to which he had traveled after a crisis of religious faith. Hunt intended to experience the actual locations of the Biblical narratives as a means to confront the relationship between faith and truth.
27	Western Post Renaissance Art	The Last of England	Ford Madox Brown	1860	Romanticism	oil, canvas	The painting depicts a man and his wife seeing England for the last time. The two main figures, based on Brown and his wife, Emma, stare ahead, stony-faced, ignoring the white cliffs of Dover which can be seen disappearing behind them in the top right of the picture. The family's clothing indicates that they are middle class, and so they are not leaving for the reasons that would force the emigration of the working classes; Brown's writing touched on the same theme: The fair-haired child in the background behind the man's shoulder is Brown and Emma's child, Catherine, who was born in 1850. The baby concealed under the woman's cloak, and whose hand she is clasping, is supposedly their second child, Oliver.
28	Western Post Renaissance Art	The Book Worm	Carl Spitzweg	1850	Biedermeier	oil, canvas	The picture is typical of Spitzweg's humorous, anecdotal style and it is characteristic of Biedermeier art in general. The painting is representative of the introspective and conservative mood in Europe during the period between the end of the Napoleonic Wars and the revolutions of 1848, but at the same time pokes fun at those attitudes by embodying them in the fusty old scholar unconcerned with the affairs of the mundane world.
29	Western Post Renaissance Art	The Angelus	Jean-Francois Millet	1859	Realism	oil, canvas	The painting depicts two peasants bowing in a field over a basket of potatoes to say a prayer, the Angelus, that together with the ringing of the bell from the church on the horizon marks the end of a day's work. Millet had originally created this work for an American, Thomas Gold Appleton, who failed to take possession of the piece. Millet later changed the painting to include a steeple in the background and changed the name from Prayer for the Potato Crop to The Angelus. The painting changed hands many times, ending with a bidding war between France and America. The painting has also been a source of speculation, due to Salvador Dali’s insistence that the figures are actually praying over their deceased child. Dali was so insistent that the painting was eventually x-rayed, revealing a shape that looked like a small coffin, indicating that Dali may have been right, and that Millet may have originally created the painting with the couple mourning over their small child’s coffin.
30	Western Post Renaissance Art	North east view from the top of Mt Kosciusko	Eugene von Guerard	1866	Romanticism	oil, canvas	Von Guérard depicted the view from Mount Townsend, the second highest point in Australia, looking towards Mount Jagungal, which is the large snow-capped peak visible on the horizon. He combined topographical accuracy with a heightened sense of wonderment at the grandeur of the landscape and the power of natural forces. In the foreground he introduced a large mound of boulders underneath which Neumayer and his assistant are shown taking barometric readings to determine the height of the mountain. Von Guérard introduced these boulders into the painting to increase the drama of the scene and to emphasise the physical insignificance of the men in the mountain landscape. In the distant sky he captured the approaching storm, which later overtook the party on the mountain.
31	Western Post Renaissance Art	The Meeting (Bonjour Monsieur Courbet)	Gustave Courbet	1854	Realism	oil, canvas	In this expansive artwork, Courbet depicts his meeting with Alfred Bruyas, a significant patron and supporter of the artist. The painting conveys the collector's admiration for Courbet's talent. The servant, as an extension of Bruyas, is captured in a gesture of utmost respect, but the key focal point is the moment of mutual appreciation shared between the artist and patron. Courbet's elevated status as a figure of great intellect and importance is highlighted by his slight backward tilt of the head and his position standing directly in the unfiltered light. However, at the same time, Courbet's sense of self-importance is also evident in the painting. His beard points towards the patron as if in judgment, while the artist's stick is double the size of Bruyas', alluding to the artist's strength and dominance.
32	Western Post Renaissance Art	Arrangement in Grey and Black No.1, Portrait of the Artist's Mother	James McNeill Whistler	1871	Realism	oil, canvas	Also known as Portrait of the Artist's Mother, this painting depicts Anna McNeill Whistler, dressed in a black gown and a white lace cap, seated in profile, and holding a white handkerchief in her lap. In the background, a reproduction of Whistler's View of the Thames is visible on the wall. The Japanese-inspired floral pattern on the curtain hanging at the left reflects the artist's interest in the Japanese aesthetic, with his signature butterfly symbol visible in the upper right corner. Although the arrangement of forms may seem simple, there is a deliberate balance of shapes at play, with the rectangular shapes of the picture on the wall, the curtain, and the floor stabilizing the sitter's form. Anna McNeill Whistler, a deeply religious woman, posed for her son after a model canceled, but due to her age, she was seated instead of standing.
33	Western Post Renaissance Art	Snap the Whip	Winslow Homer	1872	Realism	oil, canvas	In the years after America's brutal Civil War (1861-65), children—as embodiments of innocence and the promise of America's future—became a popular artistic subject. Snap the Whip, one of Homer's most beloved works, evoked nostalgia for the nation's agrarian past as the population shifted to cities. Released from their lessons, the exuberant bare-footed boys engage in a spirited game of snap the whip, which required teamwork, strength, and calculation—all important skills for a reuniting country. Their clothing, more specifically their caps, suspenders, and short pants, reflects the true late 1800 American attire. Featured in the background is the familiar little red schoolhouse; the school teachers in the distance are most likely meant to be supervising the usual recess activity. The scenic landscape of trees and wildflowers bordering a small field is so realistic that the viewer can almost hear the chirping of the birds and the buzzing of the insects. The boys' bare feet signal childhood's freedom, but their suspenders are associated with manhood's responsibilities. Observed from right to left, Homer's boys hang on to one another, strain to stay connected, run in perfect harmony, and fall away, enacting all the possible scenarios for men after the Civil War.
34	Western Post Renaissance Art	The singing of the folk song	Silvestro Lega	1867	Realism	oil, canvas	This painting transports viewers to a serene and musical moment in time. In this enchanting scene, an open window bathes the room in soft sunlight, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. A piano takes center stage, its keys ready to be played with passion and skill. On top of it lies a musical score, waiting for someone's voice to bring it to life. A woman stands beside the piano, her long skirt flowing gracefully around her as she prepares to sing. Her expression is filled with emotion and anticipation, reflecting her deep connection with the folk song she is about to perform. Behind her hangs a delicate curtain that adds an air of intimacy and mystery. 
35	Modern Art	Dance at Moulin de la Galette	Pierre-Auguste Renoir	1876	Impressionism	oil, canvas	Dance at Moulin de la Galette is one of Impressionism’s most highly revered masterpieces. The scene is of a Sunday afternoon at Moulin de la Galette, where Parisians would typically dress up and spend all day dancing, drinking, and eating galettes, or flat cakes. The painting was in the collection of Gustave Caillebotte, but it was claimed by the French government upon his death due to the non payment of death duties. It was later transferred from the Luxembourg Museum, to the Louvre, and then later to the Musee d’Orsay. Its sale price at auction in 2009 was the fifth highest price ever paid for a painting at auction.
36	Modern Art	The Scream	Edvard Munch	1893	Expressionism	oil, pastel, cardboard, tempera	The Scream is the best known and most frequently reproduced of all Munch’s motifs. With its expressive colours, its flowing lines and striking overall effect, its appeal is universal. Despite radical simplification, the landscape in the picture is recognisable as the Kristiania Fjord seen from Ekeberg, with a broad view over the fjord, the town and the hills beyond. In the background to the left, at the end of the path with the balustrade that cuts diagonally across the picture, we see two strolling figures, often regarded as two friends whom Munch mentions in notes relating to the picture. But the figure in the foreground is the first to capture the viewer’s attention. Its hands are held to its head and its mouth is wide open in a silent scream, which is amplified by the undulating movement running through the surrounding landscape. The figure is ambiguous and it is hard to say whether it is a man or a woman, young or old – or even if it is human at all. As with many of Munch’s pictures, it is assumed that here as well his starting point was private feelings and experience. His diaries contain several remarks that seem to form a background to this depiction of existential angst, among them the following: “I was walking along the road with two friends – Then the sun went down – The sky suddenly turned to blood and I felt a great scream in nature –”. The Scream was first exhibited at Munch’s solo exhibition in Berlin in 1893. It was a central element in “The Frieze of Life”, and has been the theme of probing analysis and many suggested interpretations. The painting also exists in a later version, which is in the possession of the Munch Museum. In addition Munch worked with the motif in drawings, pastels and prints.
37	Modern Art	The Starry Night	Vincent van Gogh	1889	Post-Impressionism	oil, canvas	Van Gogh's night sky is a field of roiling energy. Below the exploding stars, the village is a place of quiet order. Connecting earth and sky is the flamelike cypress, a tree traditionally associated with graveyards and mourning. But death was not ominous for van Gogh. "Looking at the stars always makes me dream," he said, "Why, I ask myself, shouldn't the shining dots of the sky be as accessible as the black dots on the map of France? Just as we take the train to get to Tarascon or Rouen, we take death to reach a star." The artist wrote of his experience to his brother Theo: "This morning I saw the country from my window a long time before sunrise, with nothing but the morning star, which looked very big." This morning star, or Venus, may be the large white star just left of center in The Starry Night. The hamlet, on the other hand, is invented, and the church spire evokes van Gogh's native land, the Netherlands. The painting, like its daytime companion, The Olive Trees, is rooted in imagination and memory. Leaving behind the Impressionist doctrine of truth to nature in favor of restless feeling and intense color, as in this highly charged picture, van Gogh made his work a touchstone for all subsequent Expressionist painting.
38	Modern Art	The Climax	Aubrey Beardsley	1893	Art Nouveau	prints	The Climax is an 1893 illustration by Aubrey Beardsley (1872–1898), a leading artist of the Decadent (1880-1900) and Aesthetic movements. It depicts a scene from Oscar Wilde's 1891 play Salome, in which the femme fatale Salome has just kissed the severed head of John the Baptist, which she grasps in her hands. Elements of eroticism, symbolism, and Orientalism are present in the piece. This illustration is one of sixteen Wilde commissioned Beardsley to create for the publication of the play. The series is considered to be Beardsley's most celebrated work, created at the age of 21.
39	Modern Art	Golconda	Rene Magritte	1953	Surrealism	oil, canvas	Magritte got the name for this painting from his poet friend Louis Scutenaire, who often helped him find names for his paintings. In this case, the name Golconda refers to a city in India, which was the seat for two different kingdoms from the 14th to 17th centuries. The richness of the region, as it was the center of the diamond industry, has become so legendary that the name is now synonymous with “mine of wealth.” As a tribute to his friend Scutenaire, Magritte used his face for the man in the painting closest to the chimney on the right hand side.
40	Modern Art	Isaac Newton	William Blake	1795	Symbolism	engraving	Newton is a monotype by the English poet, painter and printmaker William Blake first completed in 1795, but reworked and reprinted in 1805. It is one of the 12 "Large Colour Prints" or "Large Colour Printed Drawings" created between 1795 and 1805, which also include his series of images on the biblical ruler Nebuchadnezzar. Isaac Newton is shown sitting naked and crouched on a rocky outcropping covered with algae, apparently at the bottom of the sea. His attention is focused upon diagrams he draws with a compass upon a scroll that appears to unravel from his mouth. The compass is a smaller version of that held by Urizen in Blake's The Ancient of Days. Blake's opposition to the Enlightenment was deeply rooted. In his annotation to his own engraving of the classical character Laocoön, Blake wrote "Art is the Tree of Life. Science is the Tree of Death." Newton's theory of optics was especially offensive to Blake, who made a clear distinction between the vision of the "vegetative eye" and spiritual vision. The deistic view of God as a distant creator who played no role in daily affairs was anathema to Blake, who claimed to regularly experience visions of a spiritual nature. He contrasts his "four-fold vision" to the "single vision" of Newton, whose "natural religion" of scientific materialism he characterized as sterile. Newton was incorporated into Blake's infernal trinity along with the philosophers Francis Bacon and John Locke. Blake's print would later serve as the basis for Eduardo Paolozzi's 1995 bronze sculpture Newton, after William Blake, which resides in the piazza of the British Library.
41	Modern Art	Abstract Picture	Gerhard Richter	1994	Abstract Expressionism	oil, canvas	In a series of completely abstract works of the early 1990s, Richter challenges the eye of the viewer to detect anything in the field of vision other than the pure elements of his art: color, gesture, the layering of pasty materials, and the artist's impersonal raking of these concoctions in various ways that allow chance combinations to emerge from the surface. Richter suggests only a shallow space akin to that of a mirror. The viewer is finally coaxed to set aside all searches for "content" that might originate from outside these narrow parameters and find satisfaction in the object's beauty in and of itself, as though one were relishing a fine textile. One thus appreciates the numerous colors and transitions that occur in this painting, many having been created outside the complete control of the artist much as nature often creates wondrous optical pleasures partly by design, and partly by accident.
42	Modern Art	The Sleeping Gypsy	Henri Rousseau	1897	Naïve Art (Primitivism)	oil, canvas	Rousseau described the subject of The Sleeping Gypsy: “A wandering Negress, a mandolin player, lies with her jar beside her (a vase with drinking water), overcome by fatigue in a deep sleep. A lion chances to pass by, picks up her scent yet does not devour her. There is a moonlight effect, very poetic.” A toll collector for the city of Paris, Rousseau was a largely self-taught painter, although he had ambitions of entering the Academy. This goal was never realized, but his sharp colors, fantastic imagery, and precise outlines—derived from the style and subject matter of popular print culture— struck a chord with a younger generation of avant-garde painters, including Pablo Picasso, Vasily Kandinsky, and Frida Kahlo.
43	Modern Art	Guernica	Pablo Picasso	1937	Cubism	oil, canvas	Guernica was Picasso's response to the bombing of the Basque town of the same name on April 26, 1937 during the Spanish Civil War. Picasso was commissioned by the republican government of Spain to produce a mural painting for the Spanish Pavilion at the World Fair in Paris. Painted in one month - from May to June 1937 - Guernica became the centerpiece of the Spanish pavilion and a sensation at the Fair, but it was consequently banned from exhibition in Spain until military dictator Franco fell from power in 1975. Picasso had studied dramatic photographs of bombing published in various periodicals. Despite that, neither the studies nor the finished picture contain a single allusion to a specific event, constituting instead a generic plea against the barbarity and terror of war. The scene depicted in Guernica is a room full of moving, screaming and dying adults, children and animals. Most of the individual images are also symbols: a bull (virility of man), a woman with a dead child (pieta image), a horse (innocent people), a dead soldier with stigmata (martyrdom), a blazing light (bombs), a prison cell (torture), a dove (peace). Guernica is painted in monochrome, using a palette of grey, black, and white. Perhaps Picasso wanted to give his painting a veneer of photojournalistic realism; or maybe the bleak, night-time colour scheme complemented the jagged shapes and terror-stricken faces, and added to the sense of panic and terror. In any event, the lack of colour gives added impact to the flattened Cubist forms, and adds to the drama of the work by allowing Picasso to highlight key faces and objects in white. This painting is undoubtedly modern art's most famous response to war, and an international symbol of genocide committed during wartime.
44	Modern Art	Whaam!	Roy Lichtenstein	1963	Pop Art	magna, canvas	Whaam! (1963) is a two-canvas painting based on an image from the comic book strip All-American Men of War, published by DC Comics in February 1962. The left canvas depicts an American fighter plane firing a missile that hits an approaching enemy plane seen on the right canvas. The bright yellow letters ‘WHAAM!’ blaze out of the exploding airplane, describing the impact of the attack. The artist got the idea for Whaam! while working on Tex! (1962), a smaller, single panel painting that has a similar composition of a plane shooting at an enemy aircraft. The artist explained the idea of the two-canvas painting in a letter he wrote in 1967: “I remember being concerned with the idea of doing almost separate paintings having a little hint of compositional connection, and each having slightly separate stylistic character. Of course, there is the humorous connection of one panel shooting the other.” In the painting, Lichtenstein imitates the tradition of printed comic strips in the thick black lines that outline areas of primary colors, and the uniform areas of Ben-Day dots in the purple shading of the fighter plane and the sky in the background. He found this style of comic book strips and cartoons particularly appealing because it allowed him to depict emotionally charged, dramatic subject matters, like love and war, in a detached and calculated manner. In his paintings, Lichtenstein drew inspiration from popular imagery in advertising, comic books, and cartoons. Although his paintings have an element of appropriation, the artist transformed these images in his paintings. The ‘low’ mass-produced image from a comic book is transferred to the realm of high art in the traditional medium of a large-scale easel painting. During the first half of the 1960s, Lichtenstein created multiple war paintings such as Bratatat! (1963), Okay Hot-Shot, Okay! (1963) and As I Opened Fire (1964). Like Whaam! these were inspired by comic book images that glorified military action and heroism. In Lichtenstein’s paintings, these images become ironic and juvenile. Lichtenstein who served in the US Army between 1943 and 1946, painted these war paintings at a time when the Vietnam War was gaining steam. By emphasizing the irony and ridiculousness of the scenes, the artist deconstructs military heroism and glorified action-packed violence. In a 1963 interview, Lichtenstein stated: “The heroes depicted in comic books are fascist types, but I don’t take them seriously in these paintings – maybe there is a point in not taking them seriously, a political point.” Therefore, paintings like Whaam! can be interpreted as artworks that emphasize the foolishness and absurdity of war. The complexity of the Whaam! lies in its contrasts and dualities – an emotionally charged subject presented in a detached style, a commercial image placed in a fine art context, and a mass-produced image becoming a unique artwork in the form of a painting. These dualities were characteristics of the Pop art and were explored by Lichtenstein and his contemporaries, Andy Warhol and Claes Oldenburg.
45	Modern Art	Composition IV	Wassily Kandinsky	1911	Abstract Art	oil, canvas	An interesting story that indicates Kandinsky’s intellectual examination in the creation of his works revolves around this composition. He became exhausted during the months of studying he went through in preparation for this painting, and decided to go for a walk. His assistant at the time, Gabrielle Munter, who was tidying up the studio in the artist’s absence, inadvertently turned the canvas on its side. Upon Kandinsky’s return, he saw the canvas, fell to his knees and began weeping at the beauty of the painting. His newly found perspective on the piece would change his artistic vision and direction for the rest of his life.
46	Modern Art	The Wood On Its Head	Georg Baselitz	1969	Neo-Expressionism	oil, canvas	The Wood on its Head is Baselitz's first inverted painting, in which he upends his subject matter to frustrate recognition of the objects depicted. Its motif, based on a picture by the early 19th century painter Louis Ferdinand von Rayski, is similar to those found in his previous work, but here he makes them secondary to the physical properties of the medium. This radical approach troubles our ability to interpret the picture, leaving us wondering whether we are now looking at an abstraction or, simply, a conventional landscape upturned. We might read it as symptomatic of Baselitz's continuing attempts to find a different path from those that had been dominant when he emerged - the gestural abstraction of Paris and New York, and the Socialist Realism of the Eastern bloc.
47	Modern Art	Dépouille	Jean Fautrier	1945	Art Informel	mixed technique, paper, linen	One translation of Dépouille is “human remains.” This painting is from Jean Fautrier’s series Otages (or, “Hostages”), a response to the horrors inflicted by Nazi soldiers in German-occupied France during World War II. Born in Paris, Fautrier was educated in London but served in the French army during World War I. Returning to Paris in 1940 but unable to serve because of injuries sustained during that war, Fautrier was temporarily detained by the Gestapo because of his involvement in the resistance. He subsequently fled to a sanatorium in the Parisian suburb of Châtenay-Malabry, where he painted within earshot of the woods where German forces conducted massacres at night. The artist developed a technique of gluing layers of paper to canvas to create an absorbent skin-like surface on which he applied a thick impasto to render a form that may resemble a brutalized or half-buried head; in this way, Fautrier used relief painting to evoke the desecration of the body.
48	Modern Art	Still Life	Giorgio Morandi	1946	Magic Realism	oil	Morandi repeatedly painted the same selection of familiar items, including bottles, bowls, pots and boxes. In his paintings, they lose their domestic purpose, to become sculptural objects that invite meditation and contemplation. Through repeated scrutiny of these simple items, Morandi created a sense of timelessness. However, his fondness for the earthy colours of his native Bologna helps to anchor such works in the artist's own life and surroundings.
49	Modern Art	Vir heroicus sublimis	Barnett Newman	1950 - 1951	Color Field Painting	oil, canvas	Translated as "Man, heroic and sublime," Vir heroicus sublimis was, at 95" by 213", Newman's largest painting at the time it was completed, although he would go on to create even more expansive works. He intended his audiences to view this and other large paintings from a close vantage point, allowing the colors and zips to fully surround them. In this piece, which is more complex than it initially appears, Newman's zips are variously solid or wavering, creating a perfect square in the center and asymmetrical spaces on the perimeter. Mel Bochner, an artist associated with Conceptualism, remembered encountering it at MOMA in the late 1960s and realising that its scale and color created a new kind of contact between art and the viewer. "A woman standing there [looking at it].. was covered with red," he recalled. "I realised it was the light shining on the painting reflecting back, filling the space between the viewer and the artwork that created the space, the place. And that that reflection of the self of the painting, the painting as the subject reflected on the viewer, was a wholly new category of experience."
50	Modern Art	Mountains and Sea	Helen Frankenthaler	1952	Lyrical Abstraction	charcoal, oil, canvas	Initially associated with abstract expressionism, her career was launched in 1952 with the exhibition of Mountains and Sea. This painting (inspired by inspired by a trip to Nova Scotia) is large - measuring seven feet by ten feet - and has the effect of a watercolor, though it is painted in oils. In it, she introduced the technique of painting directly onto an unprepared canvas so that the material absorbs the colors. She heavily diluted the oil paint with turpentine so that the color would soak into the canvas. This technique, known as "soak stain" was used by Jackson Pollock (1912–1956), and others; and was adopted by other artists notably Morris Louis (1912–1962), and Kenneth Noland (1924–2010), and launched the second generation of the Color Field school of painting. This method would sometimes leave the canvas with a halo effect around each area to which the paint was applied but has a disadvantage in that the oil in the paints will eventually cause the canvas to discolor and rot away.
51	Modern Art	Woman with a Hat	Henri Matisse	1905	Fauvism	oil, canvas	Matisse attacked conventional portraiture with this image of his wife. Amelie's pose and dress are typical for the day, but Matisse roughly applied brilliant color across her face, hat, dress, and even the background. This shocked his contemporaries when he sent the picture to the 1905 Salon d'Automne. Leo Stein called it, "the nastiest smear of paint I had ever seen," yet he and Gertrude bought it for the importance they knew it would have to modern painting.
52	Modern Art	Zebra	Victor Vasarely	1937	Op Art	prints	Vasarely delivered one of the most important pieces of his career when he created Zebra, a painting inscribed in Op-art movement. The first version of this artwork had been made 30 years before the Op-art concept was conceived; however, it is considered to be a part of this movement. The last version of Zebra was created in 1965. Between 1939 and 1948, Vasarely laid out the fundamentals of Op-art in his early works. He was focused on studying the use of lines, the interaction between shadow and light, and the creation of perspective. Vasarely once affirmed: “The celebrated transition from the representational to nonrepresentational art is only one of the stages of profound transformation taking place in the plastics arts. The term ‘abstract’ in painting refers not to an established fact, but to an irresistible trend towards plastic creation different from the kind we already know.” Zebra can be apprehended as a study of shape, contrasts, and optical illusions. It seems like Vasarely picked the adequate animal for representing in one of the firsts pieces of the Op-art movement. In Zebra from 1937, the animals pose in front of a white background, and the contrast is obvious. Even though the background color is different, the same effect occurs with the Zebra from 1965. The stripes of the animal mesh with the background (especially in the 1965 piece) because the drawing doesn’t have borders. Also, curvilinear stripes of the zebras create an illusion of movement, playing with the awareness of the human eye.
53	Modern Art	Portrait of Felix Feneon	Paul Signac	1890	Neo-Impressionism	oil, canvas	Signac used a pencil drawing and oil sketch to portray Fénéon on the canvas, adopting the Pointillist technique, which is characteristic of Post-Impressionist style. The composition of the painting is speculated to be influenced by Georges Seurat’s 1890 gouache portrait of Signac. Signac depicted Fénéon in left profile, captured through several short sittings rather than long ones. Overall, Opus 217, Portrait of Felix Fénéon is an impressive work of art that captures the essence of Fénéon’s character and contributions to the art world. The painting is significant both as a representation of an important figure in the Neo-Impressionism movement and as an example of Post-Impressionist painting techniques.
54	Modern Art	Dubo Dubon Dubonnet	Cassandre	1932	Art Deco	Lithograph	Cassandre designed this three-part poster for the French aperitif Dubonnet in 1932. In three stages, we follow a figure presented in silhouette as he looks at his full glass, downs his drink, then fills his glass again. As he drinks, he and his surroundings are filled with colour. And not only that: the outlines of the word ‘Dubonnet’ written at the bottom of the posters also fill up. In this way, the three pictures drive the name of the drink into the memory of the viewer. Cassandre saw the design of posters as the perfect art form for modern public life, with the city serving as the artist’s canvas. With his ingenious and, above all, witty interplay of form, colour, words and picture, he was aiming to reach the hurried passer-by. The Dubonnet posters are one of his most famous and most popular designs.
55	Modern Art	Gargantua	Honore Daumier	1831	Social Realism	lithography	Comic publication La Caricature published this caricature of the French King Louis Phillippe as the nameless Gargantua character from Rabelais’s foul and crude novel, Gargantua. Like Daumier’s works, Gargantua explored the meaning of words and how or when they were judged obscene, as well as the many social institutions and their effectiveness and justification. Six months in jail at Saint Pelagic followed Daumier’s creation of an unpleasant portrait of King Louis XIV. La Caricature, the periodical that published Daumier’s work following his release and return to society, was shortly shut down after his release.
56	Modern Art	The Hay Wain	John Constable	1821	Naturalism	oil, canvas	The Hay Wain, one of Constable's most renowned works, was initially unremarkable when it was exhibited. The painting depicts the River Stour, which separates Suffolk and Essex, with Willy Lott's cottage to the left. The cart in the painting might have been positioned in the water to prevent the wooden wheels from shrinking in the sun and loosening their metal rims. The painting emanates positivity and peacefulness, conveyed through the use of color. The cool tones of the water reflect the blue of the sky, and the red of the horse's harness highlights the terracotta of the house. The greens and yellows of the vegetation frame the entire image, and the meadow on the right of the canvas opens up space to the viewer. The river's curve in the foreground directs attention towards the Hay Wain, the central focus of the painting. Constable's signature flecks of white paint on the water's surface represent the noon sunshine's reflection on the river. The painting's size (another six-footer) and the meticulously crafted light effect give the impression that the viewer is standing on the near bank of the river and can enter the scene. The painting celebrates nature's beauty without embellishment or exaggeration and reflects Constable's dedication to depicting reality as he saw it. This approach gives the scene an authentic and sincere quality that is immediately recognizable to the viewer.
57	Modern Art	Head and Shoulders of Smiling Santa Claus	Haddon Sundblom	1960 - 1969	Kitsch	oil, board	The job of creating a symbolic but realistic representation of Santa was commissioned to the illustrator Haddon Sundblom (1899-1976). Inspired by Clement Clark Moore’s poem A Visit From St. Nicholas, the artist portrayed a man with twinkling eyes, rosy cheeks, and a round belly who played with the toys he delivered and embraced the children that stayed up late waiting for him. Sundblom’s Santa was very different from the other ones: he radiated warmth and reminded people of their favorite grandfather—a friendly man who loved children and enjoyed life. And to create this human image of Santa, Sundblom used a friend of his—and later even his own self—as the model for the character. Adding a white beard flowing down over a long red coat generously outlined with fur, an enormous brass buckle fastening a broad leather belt, and large floppy boots, he painted a perfectly lovable patron saint of the season.
58	Modern Art	The Resurrection, Cookham	Stanley Spencer	1924 - 1927	Neo-Romanticism	oil, canvas	In February 1927 Spencer held his first one-man exhibition at the Goupil Gallery. The centre piece of the exhibition was The Resurrection, Cookham which received rave reviews in the British press. The Times' art critic described it as "the most important picture painted by any English artist in the present century. ... What makes it so astonishing is the combination in it of careful detail with the modern freedom of form. It is as if a Pre-Raphaelite had shaken hands with a Cubist." The huge painting is set in the grounds of the Holy Trinity Church, Cookham, and shows Spencer's friends and family from Cookham and Hampstead, and others emerging from graves watched by figures of God, Christ and the saints.[24] To the left of the church some of the resurrected are climbing over a stile, others are making their way to the river to board a Thames pleasure boat, others are simply inspecting their headstones.[25] Spencer created the picture in the early years of his marriage to Hilda and she appears three times in the picture. Overall, the Goupil exhibition was a great success with thirty-nine of the displayed paintings being sold. The Resurrection, Cookham was purchased by Lord Duveen, who presented it to the Tate.[26] After the exhibition Spencer moved to Burghclere to begin work on the Sandham Memorial Chapel for the Behrends.
59	Modern Art	Expansion in Four Directions	Max Bill	1961 - 1962	Concretism	Synthetic polymer paint on canvas	This painting shares its lozenge shape and geometric division of color with many paintings by Piet Mondrian, whose work Bill collected and in whom he was greatly interested. Bill trained at the Bauhaus in the 1920s under Josef Albers and was an architect and graphic designer as well as an artist. In his work he aimed to transcend personal artistic expression to achieve universal communication, and to this end he used mathematics as a neutralizing compositional device. The subject of an exhibition at the Museu de Arte de São Paulo in 1950 and winner of the grand prize for sculpture at the São Paulo Bienal in 1951, he helped to introduce a generation of Latin American artists to European geometric abstraction. He designed the catalogue for a 1955 Mondrian exhibition at the Zurich Kunsthaus, and lent to it three Mondrian paintings from his collection.
60	Modern Art	In those days. At the House of Unions in the days of Lenin's funeral	Konstantin Yuon	1926	Socialist Realism	wash, watercolor, paper	The painting depicts the scene outside the House of Unions in Moscow during the funeral of Vladimir Lenin, the leader of the Russian Revolution and the first head of the Soviet Union. The artwork captures the somber atmosphere of the funeral procession, with thousands of mourners gathered to pay their respects to Lenin. The painting showcases the grandeur of the House of Unions, which served as the venue for the funeral ceremony. The building is depicted in a realistic and detailed manner, highlighting its architectural beauty. Yuon's use of colors, particularly the shades of gray and black, adds to the overall solemnity of the scene. The artist skillfully portrays the emotions of the people present, their grief and reverence for Lenin. The painting also showcases the vastness of the crowd, emphasizing the impact and significance of Lenin's death on the Russian people. "In Those Days" is considered a masterpiece of Russian art, capturing a pivotal moment in history and commemorating the legacy of Lenin.
61	Modern Art	Monogram	Robert Rauschenberg	1955	Neo-Dada	mixed media	One of Rauschenberg's most famous works, Monogram, pushed the art world's buttons by further merging painting and sculpture as the combine moved from the wall to the pedestal. While he began with traditional materials - an abstract painting executed in oil on stretched canvas - he abandoned tradition by adding an assemblage of found objects on top of the painting to create a canonical, three-dimensional combine painting. Rauschenberg often acquired materials for his artwork on his meanderings about New York City, allowing chance encounters with found objects to dictate his artistic output, and Monogram was no exception. In one of his wanderings in the early 1950s, Rauschenberg found and purchased a stuffed angora goat from an office supply store and later encircled it with a tire he encountered in street trash. He applied paint to the goat's snout in gestural brushstrokes that quoted Abstract Expressionism. On top of the canvas, Rauschenberg surrounded the goat with a pasture of more detritus strewn about its hooves - including a tennis ball, a wooden plank, and several found and reproduced images. Similar to his earlier combine, Bed (1955), Monogram is a work that engages the viewer on multiple levels, as they look at, down, and around the interwoven elements of the work all vying for the viewer's attention at once. However, despite many varied interpretations, Rauschenberg refused to hint at any predetermined meaning of the different symbols within the work, instead allowing viewers to create their own associations between the objects and images. Despite Rauschenberg's insistence against specific meanings of the work, often critics interpret the tire-ringed goat as a symbol of the artist's sexuality, as well as his role within the art world, trampling over tradition with his own artistic monogram.
62	Modern Art	Colors for a Large Wall	Ellsworth Kelly	1951	Hard Edge Painting	Oil on canvas, sixty-four panels	The large-scale Colors for a Large Wall is one of Kelly's early forays into multi-panel paintings, a fundamental motif throughout his career. Colors for a Large Wall helped introduce his deeply held view of paintings as objects; not only was this painting an object in itself, but it was comprised of many smaller objects (panels) supposedly having come together in chance collision. In this work, Kelly covered each of the 64 square canvases in a single color and fused them together based on a collage study he had arbitrarily arranged. Much of Kelly's subsequent work stemmed from this painting, as he continued to juxtapose panels of differing sizes, shapes, colors and materials in innumerable variations.
63	Modern Art	The Mud Bath	David Bomberg	1914	Constructivism	oil, canvas	The Mud Bath is a 1914 oil-on-canvas painting by David Bomberg. The work is considered a masterpiece of Bomberg's work in this period. Bomberg was a founder member of the London Group, and the painting is considered a leading example of Vorticism, although Bomberg resisted being described as a Vorticist. The painting is a striking composition of human figures formed from white and blue geometric planes and angles, in a rectangular bath of vibrant red surrounded by a landscape of mustard brown, arranged around a brown and black vertical element (perhaps a column at the baths). There is a suggestion that the bathers are waving their arms as if in a Bacchanalian revel. The scene is based on Schewzik Russian Vapour Baths in Brick Lane, Whitechapel, near Bomberg's home in east London, which was used by the local Jewish population for cleanliness and for religious observances, including the mikveh ritual bath. Bomberg's Jewishness was a very important part of his identity as an artist. The bathing room, with a communal bath approximately 10-foot square and balcony above, was open to either men and women on different days, and may have been the inspiration for his 1913 work, Ju-Jitsu, but did not contain a mud bath.
64	Modern Art	Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte	Georges Seurat	1884 - 1886	Pointillism	oil, canvas	This most famous and influential Neo-Impressionist work depicts a cross-section of Paris society enjoying a Sunday afternoon in the park on an island in the Seine River just at the gates of Paris. Sunday was the time that middle-class Parisians escaped the city to enjoy the outdoors. The people primarily gather in small groups of two or three or sit alone in proximity to others. It is the relationship between these people that creates a sense of modernity, with its distance and disconnection, and nervous tension that lends the work an air of mystery. Using a grid system and applying small dots of paint, Seurat took two years to complete this large-scale painting. He went to the park often, observing and making over 60 preliminary studies, including 15 in oil. Invoking Greek classical art, Seurat explained, "The Panathenaeans of Phidias formed a procession. I want to make modern people, in their essential traits, move about as they do on those friezes, and place them on canvases organized by harmonies of color." Seurat hoped to capture the permanence, or essential forms, behind the fleeting moments. Everyone here is caught in a still pose, except for the child in the orange dress skipping off into the trees, the man on the far left playing trombone, and the furious little dog at the lower right. However, it seems a stillness that might burst into movement at any moment, just as the upper half of the painting moves into the sunlight and the boats in the distance cut across the river. While Seurat invoked classical and Egyptian figures, some have interpreted the overall static effect of the composition and the stiffness of the poses as a critique of the artificiality of modern society and the boredom of middle-class life.
65	Modern Art	American Gothic	Grant Wood	1930	Regionalism	oil, board	Grant Wood adopted the precise realism of 15th-century northern European artists, but his native Iowa provided the artist with his subject matter. American Gothic depicts a farmer and his spinster daughter posing before their house, whose gabled window and tracery, in the American gothic style, inspired the painting's title. In fact, the models were the painter's sister and their dentist. Wood was accused of creating in this work a satire on the intolerance and rigidity that the insular nature of rural life can produce; he denied the accusation. American Gothic is an image that epitomizes the Puritan ethic and virtues that he believed dignified the Midwestern character.
66	Modern Art	The Night	Pierre Alechinsky	1952	Tachisme	intaglio, paper	In the upper part of Something of a World the artist transcribed his own poem in mirror-image with both hands simultaneously. The personal quality of hand-writing greatly appealed to CoBrA artists. ‘The important thing,’ Alechinsky wrote, ‘is to discover an inner script ... with which we can explore ourselves organically.’ Alechinsky said that he painted as if he was a spinning-top, unable to control his own movements. This is evident in The Night in which twists and twirls of white on a black ground evoke luminous night forms.
67	Modern Art	Agony in the Garden	Miriam Schapiro	1991	Feminist Art	Acrylic on canvas with glitter	This large-scale painting is one in an ongoing Collaboration series begun in the mid-1970s, in which Schapiro dialogues with and pays homage to famous women artists, in this instance Frida Kahlo, whose self-portrait The Broken Column, 1944, is reproduced in the center. Schapiro is a pioneering feminist artist who, with Judy Chicago, founded the Feminist Art Program at the California Institute of the Arts in 1971, the first program of its kind to encourage women to make art from their personal experiences. A leader in the Pattern and Decoration movement, Schapiro is known for her “femmages,” or collage paintings, which aim to reclaim traditional handicrafts associated with women’s work, such as embroidery and sewing. Stylistically this painting mimics the look of a collage, recalling Schapiro’s long-standing commitment to the belief that decorative elements and women’s work are viable artistic means to express female experience, having both political and subversive potential.
68	Modern Art	Winter – Fifth Avenue	Alfred Stieglitz	1893	Pictorialism	photo	Stieglitz later wrote that this photograph was the result of a three-hour wait in a rather inclement snow storm: “In order to obtain pictures by means of the hand camera it is well to choose your subject, regardless of figures, and carefully study the lines and lighting. After having determined upon these watch the passing figures and await the moment in which everything is in balance; that is, satisfies your eye. This often means hours of patient waiting. My picture, ‘Fifth Avenue, Winter,’ is the result of a three hours’ stand during a fierce snow-storm on February 22d, 1893, awaiting the proper moment. My patience was duly rewarded. Of course, the result contained an element of chance, as I might have stood there for hours without succeeding in getting the desired picture." The picture depicts a carriage driving through a snowy urban landscape. The effect of the snow blurring gives the picture an impressionistic atmosphere.[3] The picture was later wrongly dated by the author as having been taken on 22 February 1892, but it only could have been made the following year, on 22 February 1893, judging by the weather descriptions of both days.
69	Modern Art	Grand Maitre of the Outsider	Jean Dubuffet	1947	Art Brut	oil, emulsion, canvas	This pictures is typical of the Hautes Pates series that Dubuffet exhibited to huge controversy in 1946. A thick, monochromatic surface serves as the ground for the crudely depicted figure, which is a parody of portraiture. Although Dubuffet undoubtedly intended the series to offend, and his graphic style and thick, coarse impasto certainly did offend conventional tastes, it is worth noting that the color palette is not as jarring as it might be. Dubuffet was at least cautiously mindful of the need for success.
70	Modern Art	Fountain	Marcel Duchamp	1917	Dada	ready-made	Fountain is one of Duchamp's most famous works and is widely seen as an icon of twentieth-century art. The original, which is now lost, consisted of a standard urinal, laid flat on its back rather than upright in its usual position, and signed 'R. Mutt 1917'. The Tate's work is a 1964 replica and is made from glazed earthenware painted to resemble the original porcelain. The signature is reproduced in black paint. Fountain is an example of what Duchamp called a 'readymade', an ordinary manufactured object designated by the artist as a work of art. It epitomises the assault on convention and good taste for which he and the Dada movement are best known. The idea of designating such a lowly object as a work of art came from a discussion between Duchamp and his American friends the collector Walter Arensburg and the artist Joseph Stella. Following this conversation, Duchamp bought an urinal from a plumbers' merchants, and submitted it to an exhibition organised by the Society of Independent Artists. The Board of Directors, who were bound by the constitution of the Society to accept all members' submissions, took exception to the Fountain and refused to exhibit it. Duchamp and Arensburg, who were both on the Board, resigned immediately in protest. An article published at the time, which is thought to have been written by Duchamp, claimed, 'Mr Mutt's fountain is not immoral, that is absurd, no more than a bathtub is immoral. It is a fixture that you see every day in plumbers' shop windows. Whether Mr Mutt with his own hands made the fountain has no importance. He CHOSE it. He took an ordinary article of life, placed it so that its useful significance disappeared under the new title and point of view - created a new thought for that object.' ('The Richard Mutt Case', The Blind Man, New York, no.2, May 1917, p.5.) Later in life Duchamp commented on the name of the alter ego he created for this work: 'Mutt comes from Mott Works, the name of a large sanitary equipment manufacturer. But Mott was too close so I altered it to Mutt, after the daily cartoon strip 'Mutt and Jeff' which appeared at the time, and with which everyone was familiar. Thus, from the start, there was an interplay of Mutt: a fat little funny man, and Jeff: a tall thin man ... I wanted any old name, And I added Richard [French slang for moneybags]. That's not a bad name for a pissotière. Get it? The opposite of poverty. But not even that much, just R. MUTT.' (quoted in Schwarz, p.649.) Duchamp's use of a false signature, 'R. Mutt', anticipates his adoption of the alter ego Rrose Sélavy a few years later (indeed, in a letter of the period Duchamp referred to Mutt as a woman). Some commentators have noted how the inverted urinal resembles a female body, and see this as reflecting the play with gender boundaries which was an important leitmotif of Duchamp's career. Soon after the 1917 exhibition, Duchamp took Fountain to be photographed by his friend, the photographer and gallery owner Alfred Steiglitz. Since the original was lost thereafter, this photograph (reproduced in Ades, p.129) became the basis for the later replicas. Altogether fifteen authorised replicas of Fountain were issued, one in 1951, 1953 and 1963 respectively and a further twelve in 1964. The Tate's version is number two in an edition of eight made by the Galleria Schwarz in Milan in October 1964. Four further examples were also made at this time, one for both Duchamp and Arturo Schwarz, and two for museum exhibition. Duchamp signed each of these replicas on the back of the left flange 'Marcel Duchamp 1964'. There is also a copperplate on the base of each work etched with Duchamp's signature, the dates of the original and the replica, the title, the edition number and the publisher's name, 'Galleria Schwarz, Milan'.
71	Modern Art	Early Sunday Morning	Edward Hopper	1930	New Realism	oil, canvas	The painting portrays the small businesses and shops of Seventh Avenue in New York City shortly after sunrise. Hopper created this work based on an experience in Greenwich, NY, in which he takes an early morning walk. The painting reflects his deep interest in being alone with his thoughts. It's an ambiguous scene as key details such as road signs are left out - it could be anywhere in the United States. A barbers shop is the only sign of business or even any life within the area. This painting is an example of his striking use of light to create an ethereal mood. It is stark and efficient and conveys a sense of desolation, yet the lighting softens these characteristics.
72	Modern Art	The Two Mothers	Giovanni Segantini	1889	Divisionism	oil, canvas	Presented at the inaugural Milan Triennale in 1891, Le due madri is one of Segantini's most celebrated and talked-about works, and affirmed the revolutionary new technique known as Divisionism. This genre scene, traditional only in appearance, represents the first step in Segantini's progression towards a so-called "painting of ideas." The woman with the baby, and the cow with her calf, are elevated into universal symbols of motherhood. The studied effect of artificial light, shown in the rendering of the lantern-lit stable, gives this humble scene an intensity that could only be achieved via the Divisionist technique. Inspired by a profound and sincere sense of observation, this scene is captured through filamented brushstrokes of divided colors, with pure colors applied directly to the canvas. The final effect is a work whose meaning goes beyond reality and aspires to represent a universal image of the origins of life.
73	Modern Art	The City Rises	Umberto Boccioni	1910	Futurism	oil, canvas	The City Rises is considered by many to be the very first truly Futurist painting. Boccioni took a year to complete it and it was exhibited throughout Europe shortly after it was finished. It testifies to the hold that Neo-Impressionism and Symbolism maintained on the movement's artists even after Futurism was inaugurated in 1909. It was not until around 1911 that Boccioni adapted elements of Cubism to create a distinct Futurist style. Nevertheless, The City Rises does capture the group's love of dynamism and their fondness for the modern city. A large horse races into the foreground while several workers struggle to gain control of it, suggesting a primeval conflict between humanity and beasts. The horse and figures are blurred, communicating rapid movement while other elements, such as the buildings in the background, are rendered more realistically. At the same time, the perspective teeters dramatically in different sections of the painting.
74	Modern Art	Nocturne in Black and Gold – the Falling Rocket	James McNeill Whistler	1875	Tonalism	oil, board	Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket (1875) is the final piece in Whistler's series of nocturnes, and one of only six to depict London's Cremorne Gardens. In this painting, Whistler portrays a fireworks display in the night sky, conveying a sense of excitement and celebration. Rather than offering a clear image, the artist's sweeping brushstrokes of dark blues and greens, interrupted by small bursts of bright color, capture the effects of fireworks over the river, exemplifying the Aesthetic principle of "art for art's sake." Whistler described the painting as conveying a "dreamy, pensive mood" rather than a narrative. Despite its significance as an early example of abstraction, The Falling Rocket was not initially well received. Critics questioned the value of the seemingly convoluted subject matter and criticized what they perceived as Whistler's reckless and careless painting technique. The negative review by John Ruskin prompted Whistler to sue for libel, submitting this painting, along with other nocturnes, as evidence. Ruskin's condemnation of Whistler's work as representative of "the modern school" proved accurate, as Whistler's technique of flicking paint at the canvas to create the fireworks influenced later modern artists, most notably Jackson Pollock.
75	Modern Art	Metro Bee	Robert Huot	1963	Post-Painterly Abstraction	stainless steel	Metro Bee is a sculpture created by American artist Robert Huot. It was completed in 1979 and is made of stainless steel. The sculpture is located in the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota, specifically in the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden. Metro Bee is a large-scale abstract representation of a bee. It stands at approximately 15 feet tall and is characterized by its sleek and geometric design. The sculpture features clean lines and sharp angles, giving it a modern and contemporary aesthetic. Huot's intention with Metro Bee was to create a visually striking and engaging artwork that would capture the attention of viewers. The sculpture's placement in the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden allows it to interact with the surrounding environment, creating a dynamic and engaging experience for visitors. Metro Bee has become an iconic landmark in Minneapolis and is often associated with the city's vibrant arts scene. It serves as a testament to the creativity and innovation of Huot's artistic vision and continues to be a beloved and admired artwork in the community.
76	Modern Art	Dempsey and Firpo	George Bellows	1924	American Realism	oil, canvas	The painting depicts the famous boxing match that took place on September 14, 1923 between the boxer Jack Dempsey (depicted in white shorts) and his Argentinean rival, Luis Angel Firpo (in purple shorts). Firpo knocks his opponent out of the ring here, but, in reality, Dempsey won the match. Bellows is noted for the high contrasts and for the angle that places the viewer in the audience. The balding man at the far left of the picture represents Bellows himself.
77	Modern Art	I Saw the Figure 5 in Gold (William Carlos Williams)	Charles Demuth	1928	Precisionism	oil, paper	"I Saw the Figure 5 in Gold" is one of a series of eight abstract portraits of friends, inspired by Gertrude Stein's word-portraits, that Demuth made between 1924 and 1929. This painting pays homage to a poem by William Carlos Williams. Like Marsden Hartley's "Portrait of a German Officer" and Arthur Dove's "Ralph Dusenberry," this portrait consists not of a physical likeness of the artist's friend but of an accumulation of images associated with him — the poet's initials and the names "Bill" and "Carlos" that together form a portrait. Williams' poem "The Great Figure" describes the experience of seeing a red fire engine with the number 5 painted on it racing through the city streets. While Demuth's painting is not an illustration of Williams's poem, we can certainly sense its "rain/and lights" and the "gong clangs/siren howls/and wheels rumbling." The bold 5 both rapidly recedes and races forward in space, and the round forms of the number, the lights, the street lamp, and the arcs at the lower left and upper right are played against the straight lines of the fire engine, the buildings, and the rays of light, infusing the picture with a rushing energy that perfectly expresses the spirit of the poem.
78	Modern Art	Anthropometry: Princess Helena	Yves Klein	1960	Nouveau Réalisme	Oil on paper on wood	Klein employed female models as "living paintbrushes" to make this work and others in his Anthropometry series, named after the study of human body measurements. "In this way," the artist said, "I stayed clean. I no longer dirtied myself with color, not even the tips of my fingers." Klein directed the models, covered in International Klein Blue—his patented blue paint—to make imprints of their bodies on large sheets of paper. He staged the making of Anthropometries as elaborate performances for an audience, complete with blue cocktails and a performance of his Monotone Symphony—a single note played for twenty minutes, followed by twenty minutes of silence.
79	Modern Art	Kinetic Construction (Standing Wave)	Naum Gabo	1919 - 1920	Kinetic Art	wood, metal	In the aftermath of the Russian Revolution, when this work was made, materials were hard to come by. 'It was the height of civil war, hunger and disorder in Russia. To find any part of machinery was next to impossible', said Gabo. Originally made to demonstrate the principles of kinetics to his students, it reflects the artist's belief in a sculpture in which space and time were active components. A strip of metal is made to oscillate so that a standing wave is set up. This movement in real time creates the illusion of volumetric space.
80	Modern Art	Windows	Robert Delaunay	1912	Orphism	Oil and wax on canvas	In his Windows series, a group of twenty-two paintings made between April and December of 1912, Delaunay rejected painting’s traditional function as a window onto an imaginary world. Instead he turned to the pictorial surface as a place where the process of seeing itself could be recorded. “Without visual perception there is no light, no movement,” Delaunay wrote in the summer of 1912. “This movement is provided by relationships of uneven measures, by color contrasts, which constitute Reality.” Light and its structuring of vision, the simultaneous contrasts of colors and their steady rhythmic motion, became the subjects of Delaunay’s Windows, setting the stage for his move into abstraction. “The Windows,” he wrote, “truly began my life as an artist.”
81	Modern Art	Mystery and Melancholy of a Street	Giorgio de Chirico	1914	Metaphysical art	oil, canvas	The painting represents an encounter between two figures: a small girl running with a hoop and a statue that is present in the painting only through its shadow. The girl is moving towards the source of bright light coming from behind the building on the right and illuminating intensively the arcades on the left. The bright yellow corridor stretched up to the horizon separates two zones: light and darkness. If you look closely at the two sharply contrasted buildings you will notice that lightning is not their only distinction. De Chirico intentionally used two contradictory vanishing points (a point in the picture plane that is the intersection of the projections (or drawings) of a set of parallel lines), thus destroying any resemblance to reality. All of the lines of the fully illuminated building on the left meet slightly above the horizon; the alignments of the dark building meet at a point where the truck roof touches the yellow of the ground. One last detail concerning the perspective is an isometric depiction of a truck, or freight car, mysteriously lit by a light coming from…well, nowhere. This juxtaposition of light sources and perspectives enabled de Chirico to create a mysterious and impossible universe where spaces will never converge and the girl will never reach the statue.
82	Modern Art	Dawn	Odd Nerdrum	1990	Neo-baroque	oil, canvas	Dawn is an example of the imaginary world the artist projects in his paintings: in this case, it is a bleak and barren landscape populated by four figures. The artist presents a surreal scene: four male figures, identical in appearance, are seated turned sideways with their mouths gaping. Even though they are a group, these figures do not relate to each other. Nerdrum repeats this scheme in other paintings such as Wanderers by the Sea (2001), Dust Lickers (2005) and Limbo (2006). In Dawn, the mysterious nature of the painting is enhanced by the strange garments. For instance, the figures upper limbs are restricted by the black cloaks that cover the top halves of their bodies.

83	Modern Art	Violin and Pipe, 'Le Quotidien'	Georges Braque	1913	Synthetic Cubism	chalk, charcoal, collage, paper	Collage helped Braque to realize that, "color acts simultaneously with form but has nothing to do with it,". He made collages to inspire painting compositions, but also as works themselves. In Violin and Pipe, he chooses a stringed instrument as his subject matter. Since there is no concrete evidence that this is a violin, one can understand better how Braque is studying the shapes within the object and pulling them apart to move them around, as if shuffling a deck of cards.
84	Modern Art	Creation	Diego Rivera	1922 - 1923	Muralism	fresco, gold leaf	His first government-commissioned mural, Creation was created over the course of a year and covers over a thousand square feet. The figures in the mural are over twelve feet high, which were in proportion to the huge pipe organ which surrounded the wall. Although it was widely popular, Rivera felt that the painting was too Italian in technique, and he did not like it. During the painting of the mural, Rivera felt compelled to carry a pistol with him at all times, to protect himself from the right-wing students.
85	Modern Art	Japan's (Camille Monet in Japanese Costume)	Claude Monet	1876	Japonism	oil, canvas	Monet exhibited this work at the second group show of the Impressionist painters in 1876, where it attracted much attention. Large-scale figure paintings had traditionally been considered the most significant challenge for an artist. Using this format, Monet created a virtuoso display of brilliant color that is also a witty comment on the current Paris fad for all things Japanese. The woman shown wrapped in a splendid kimono and surrounded by fans is Monet's wife, Camille, wearing a blond wig to emphasize her Western identity.
86	Modern Art	Cyclist	Natalia Goncharova	1913	Cubo-Futurism	oil, canvas	The titular cyclist is a male figure bent over his bicycle while pedaling through a town or city. The street beneath the cyclist is cobbled while behind him lies a row of shop windows. Goncharova was an early Russian developer of Cubo-Futurism, combining characteristics of both Futurism and Cubism in Cyclist. Cubist fragmentation, for example, is used to indicate the cyclist's speed. Movement is also portrayed in the work's Futurist elements, such as its repetition of forms and dislocation of contours. The dynamic effect of multiplied forms and repeated delineation is further amplified by Goncharova's use of broad brushstrokes. The presence of urban life, another concern of Futurism, is included in the work through the use of street signs in the background. However, the composition is distinct from classical Futurist works due to its higher level of visual balance. In particular, Cyclist contrasts with the more abstract and dematerialized representation of cycling found in Umberto Boccioni's 1913 painting Dynamism of a Cyclist.
87	Modern Art	The Vision after the Sermon (Jacob wrestling with the Angel)	Paul Gauguin	1888	Cloisonnism	oil, canvas	One of the most famous works by Paul Gauguin, Vision After the Sermon: Jacob Wrestling with the Angel (1888) was painted during the artist's stay in Pont-Aven, Brittany. The painting refers to the biblical story of Jacob, who crossed the river Jabbok and spent the night wrestling a mysterious angel. The artist depicts the subject indirectly, showing a group of Breton women after a sermon in church. The women moved by the sermon see a vision of Jacob wrestling the angel. The available information about the painting comes primarily from two sources: letters written by Gauguin and writings by Post-Impressionist artist Emile Bernard. Bernard spent the summer of 1888 with Gauguin in Pont-Aven – the two worked side by side, and while Gauguin painted Vision After the Sermon Bernard worked on the painting Breton Women in the Meadow (1888). The two paintings share stylistic similarities and are both examples of Cloisonnism – a post-impressionist style characterized by bold flat forms enclosed by dark outlines. Both artists also shared an affinity for Japanese art, and Bernard wrote that the motif of Jacob wrestling the angel in Vision After the Sermon was modeled after Hokusai’s Sumo Wrestlers.
88	Modern Art	Broadway Boogie Woogie	Piet Mondrian	1942 - 1943	Neoplasticism	oil, canvas	Considered Mondrian’s masterpiece, Broadway Boogie Woogie is a shimmering combination of multi-colored grid lines, complete with blocks of color, all in the primary palette. This piece represents another development in the unique style of the artist, which may have been the most profound. After the abandonment of representational forms in 1913 and the reconciliation of his spiritual concerns with his aesthetic, Mondrian had finally developed the transition of solid black lines to lines consisting of multi-colored, vibrant hues, creating an entirely new feeling. This painting represents Mondrian’s seminal work as an artist, and unlike much of his work, is not entirely non-representational. One can see the grid of the Manhattan city streets and feel the beat of the boogie woogie music of which Mondrian was so fond.
89	Modern Art	Still Life	Le Corbusier	1920	Purism	oil, canvas	Le Corbusier’s Still Life (1920) is a typical Purist painting. He purified the colour scheme to include only the neutrals—gray, black, and white—and monochromes of green. He applied the paint smoothly to enhance the sense of impersonal objectivity. He also repeated the rhythmic, curving contours of a guitar (a favourite Cubist motif, which the Purists eventually rejected for being too picturesque) in the shoulders of a bottle and in other objects on the table; by tilting the tops of the objects toward the spectator, he gave an added emphasis to their flatness. A motif of circles is echoed in the various openings of the bottles, pipes, and containers. In such works, Le Corbusier and Ozenfant were attempting to create a “symphony of consonant and architectured forms.”
90	Modern Art	Spatial Concept: Expectations	Lucio Fontana	1959	Spatialism	Synthetic polymer paint on slashed burlap	Inspired by Futurism, Fontana sought to escape the “prison” of the flat picture surface to explore movement, time, and space. In 1949 he first developed his Spatial Concepts, puncturing and piercing the surfaces of sheets of paper to reach behind and beyond the illusionistic plane into what he called “a free space.” In the late 1950s Fontana began to slash linear cuts into stretched canvases; shedding its materiality, line became coextensive with infinite space.
91	Contemporary Art	Poured Lines: Light Violet, Green, Blue, Red, Violet	Ian Davenport	1995	Color Field Painting	Household paint on canvas	Light Violet, Green, Blue, Red, Violet lines of paint seems as if it is poured from top to bottom. 
92	Contemporary Art	Untitled	Donald Judd	1990	Minimalism	Aluminium, steel and acrylic	Untitled 1990 is a wall-based work by the American artist Donald Judd. It comprises ten identical rectangular boxes, each with sides made of blue anodised aluminium and top and bottom faces made of clear acrylic sheeting. The units are fixed to the wall at one of their long sides, and are positioned one above another in a vertical arrangement. Each box is separated from the next by a distance equal to its height, and this same distance separates the bottom of the lowest unit and the floor. The display instructions stipulate that there must also be a gap of at least the height of one box between the uppermost unit and the ceiling, and if the ceiling of the gallery is too low to accommodate this, the number of units featured in the work must be reduced in order to achieve it. The considerable depth of the units means that Untitled projects some way out from the wall, and although it has a relationship with both the wall and the space around it, works such as this were not regarded by Judd as either painting or sculpture, but rather as examples of what the artist referred to in 1965 as ‘three-dimensional work’
93	Contemporary Art	180 Colors	Gerhard Richter	1971	Conceptual Art, Op Art	Enamel paint on canvas	While many abstract paintings are about expression or purity, 180 Colors is about nothing so lofty. Richter used a systematic approach to determine the rich variety of colors: he produced its 180 different colors by combining the three primary colors to get twelve hues and then mixing fifteen tones of each varying from light to dark. The surface, composed of glossy enamel paint, is flawless and shiny. Another key element of this painting is literally not there at all: From a distance, an optical illusion of gray dots seems to hover at the corners of the colored blocks.
94	Contemporary Art	Self-Portrait	Chuck Close	2000	Photorealism	111 color silkscreen, hand-drawn separations	In Close’s work, the “pixilated” images “are filled with tiny abstract colored shapes, individual brushstrokes or even the artist’s fingerprints. When viewed from a distance, the individual marks miraculously resolve into a surprisingly realistic face,” 
95	Contemporary Art	Forever (Bicycles)	Ai Weiwei	2003	Conceptual Art, Excessivism	42 bicycles	The towering circular sculpture is created by dismantling forty-two Yongjiu bicycles, a household Chinese bicycle brand which translates to Forever. The company began producing bicycles in Shanghai in 1940, and has since then become the leading manufacturer in the country. Bicycles are part of everyday life in China, their presence ubiquitous across streets and alleyways. However, with the rapid modernisation in recent years, these ‘Forever’ brand bicycles have been slowly disappearing from the streets. The most common form of transportation, bicycles are part of the lived experience of everyday Chinese people, and are also symbolic of the peasant revolution and socialist utopia that has never been achieved. Increasingly replaced by motorcycles or cars, a tinge of nostalgia accompanies the irony of the word ‘forever’. Playfully arranged in a carousel, these fragments of bicycles speak of continuity and change, tradition and revolution. Plain, humble and deeply poetic, Ai Weiwei captures a sense of loss that pervades the rapidly changing streets of China.
96	Contemporary Art	Spiral Jetty	Robert Smithson	1970	Environmental (Land) Art	basalt rocks and water	Built on the northeastern shore of the Great Salt Lake near Rozel Point in Utah entirely of mud, salt crystals, basalt rocks and water, Spiral Jetty forms a 1,500-foot-long (460 m), 15-foot-wide (4.6 m) counterclockwise coil jutting from the shore of the lake. The water level of the lake varies with precipitation in the mountains surrounding the area, revealing the jetty in times of drought and submerging it during times of normal precipitation.
97	Contemporary Art	Flower thrower	Banksy	2003	Street art, Graffiti art	screenprint	Banksy's Love Is In The Air (Flower Thrower) prints feature a powerful anti-war image, poignantly debuted as a mural on the West Bank Wall. The artwork depicts a man dressed in black, wearing a backwards baseball cap and a bandana across his face, poised to throw an item. From the way he is dressed, the viewer first presumes he is about to throw a brick or a petrol bomb. The bundle in his hand, however, is a bouquet of flowers in a symbolic appeal for peace to replace violence.
98	Japanese Art	The Great Wave off Kanagawa	Katsushika Hokusai	1831	Ukiyo-e	woodblock print	This is the most famous print created by Katsushika Hokusai, and it continues to grow in popularity and recognition worldwide. The image is of two boats, full of Japanese sailors, coming up against the namesake of the print, the Great Wave. The wave looks as if it will swallow the boats whole, and that the boat men are sure to be devoured in the wave. Although it is such a strong image, it is simplistically beautiful, with curling blue waves and white frothy tips, which menacingly curl down into points, like claws ready to scoop the sailors out of the sea.
99	Japanese Art	​Ascension of Polkadots on the Trees	Yayoi Kusama	2006	Conceptual Art	red polyester fabric	Kusama, who is famous for her large scale polka dot-filled artworks, used bungee cords and metal staples to tightly wrap several trees in a red polyester fabric covered in white spots.
100	Korean Art	Lovers under the moon	Shin Yoon-bok	1805	Oriental painting	Color on paper	a master of genre painting of the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910), depicts the bittersweet moment when two lovers must bid farewell after a brief rendezvous under the moonlight, capturing the basic human emotions of ardent love and heartache of separation. The painting depicts a man and woman standing, side by side on the right side of the painting. To the left, there is a crescent moon suspended in the sky over a house rooftop. The man and woman are having a rendezvous in an alleyway late at night. From his clothes we can guess the man’s status as a nobleman. Holding a lantern in his right hand, he seems to be reaching for something in his pocket with his left hand. The man’s face is turned in the opposite direction, gazing longingly at the woman with lingering affection though he seems to be reaching for something in his pocket with his left hand. The woman’s attire indicates that she is an upper-class lady. Her face, which is partly revealed below the hood, is turned toward the man, her eyes downcast with dismay.
